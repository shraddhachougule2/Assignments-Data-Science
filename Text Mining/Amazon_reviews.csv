"Reviewing it after my replacement order. First one had mic problem with the right bud. Replacement is working so far fine without any glitch. Amazing tws ear buds, bud build quality is good but case somewhat ok type.Pros:1. Bass is thumping kind.2. All low, mid and high tones good and clear, respond clearly as per the eq settings.3. Battery backup is like never seen before on any of the TWS so far, lasted more than 9 hrs on full charge without the case.4. So light that u feel once adjusted, you won't feel itchiness, exact size silicon caps selection plays important role.5. Although case build quality is not upto the mark but fits in any of the jeans coin packet easily.6. Call quality is absolutely so great that the other party couldn't even recognize you're on a headphone unless you're on streets as there is no ANC.Cons:1. All the buds are of plastic glossy feel attract dust and fingerprints.2. The not mentioned gaming mode zero latency that most youtubers blown in their recent reviews is just a gimmick, I didn't even spot any difference between the selections.3. Some pair of buds got mic problem like I'd got with my first pair, but the replacement pair worked fine so far.4. Bass is clear when u make perfect fit silicon straps. Wudve been perfect Basshead, if driver placed near to silicon caps. There is little bit of sound leakage I felt.5. Volume doesn't reach its loudness, need to use sound control apps for horror or some intensive low sound movies if you're watching.Overall a very good budget tws earbud.Thumps up for Amazon's quickest delivery even during this essentials only days! Hats off to all amazon's frontline delivery partners.The replacement also didn't take much of my time."

 Very nice product bass is also nice at this price point and vocals, treble and call quality is very nice. Everything is superb battery life also very nice sound output is also nice no disturbance and distortion. Very nice product. Sound quality also varies with ear size and ear tip size so try changing eartips from medium to other size based on your ear I changed to small then I got it fit perfectly in ear"
"I really like the product Premium, Classy and resembles airpods. Am happy with this product .Type c charging is provided which is useful. Must buy earbuds.. Awesome sound effect. Same sound quality as boat headsets. Overall performance is fabulous in this price range and I highly recommend It's is completely worth."
Honest review which no one will tell. Always hiss noise comes from the earbuds which is very irritating.Disconnection happens every now and then if you move a little away.It takes more time to charge fully than as it is mentioned.
Just received these a couple hours ago. I'm not sure if it's a defective product or not cuz the sound quality is just downright horrible. Vocals barely audible at max volume forget about bass. Tried with different phones. IOS and android. They sound the same. HORRIBLE. I've already ordered a replacement. Will update if they're any different.Edit.: received replacement today. Sound exactly the same. I'm perplexed as to how people are praising these and liking how they sound. They're exactly how fake tws sound if not worse. Wouldn't advise anyone to buy this.
Honestly I don't know what to say. I purchased it after reading positive reviews. Even after charging for 6hours it's say low better. Sound quality is average. Changing is a big issue. Waste of money. I had same issue with 1st product I received & requested for replacement. Product which I received after replacement have same issue. I wish if I could give 0 stars. It past the 8days of expected date of pickup but no one came to pick up. Such a unsatisfied customer service.
I am writing this review after 2 months ...Earphone is very cute and light box but after 2 months with occasional use hardly 10 times use the one piece is not charging at all.
I got my Boult Audio Airbass and it arrived in less time than expected the sound quality of this Bolt audio is super cool and the noise cancellation feature is also good that works very fine.the thing that I like the most about this product is that  the battery life of this product is till 24 hour that is more than enough for daily usage.and for the gamers it is Uber cool that it has a less sound latency and you can turn it on whenever you want..
The sound quality is horrible. The reception range is less than 1 metre.  It seems I got cheated on buying this. Now they should return the product and pay back.  I am Amazon pime customer and helpless after buying this.  Amazon should consider to return the product in place of replace.
"I received the product in 1 day, first experience was ok , light weight & good sound etc, but when the battery went low, it can't be charged. If it is not charging how can be used, so I ordered for replacement."

Battery backup is like never seen before on any of the TWS so far, lasted more than 9 hrs on full charge without the case.4. So light that u feel once adjusted, you won't feel itchiness, exact size silicon caps selection plays important role.5. Although case build quality is not upto the mark but fits in any of the jeans coin packet easily.6. Call quality is absolutely so great that the other party couldn't even recognize you're on a headphone unless you're on streets as there is no ANC.Cons:1. All the buds are of plastic glossy feel attract dust and fingerprints.2. The not mentioned gaming mode zero latency that most youtubers blown in their recent reviews is just a gimmick, I didn't even spot any difference between the selections.3. Some pair of buds got mic problem like I'd got with my first pair, but the replacement pair worked fine so far.4. Bass is clear when u make perfect fit silicon straps. Wudve been perfect Basshead, if driver placed near to silicon caps. There is little bit of sound leakage I felt.5. Volume doesn't reach its loudness, need to use sound control apps for horror or some intensive low sound movies if you're watching.Overall a very good budget tws earbud.Thumps up for Amazon's quickest delivery even during this essentials only days! Hats off to all amazon's frontline delivery partners.The replacement also didn't take much of my time."

 Very nice product bass is also nice at this price point and vocals, treble and call quality is very nice. Everything is superb battery life also very nice sound output is also nice no disturbance and distortion. Very nice product. Sound quality also varies with ear size and ear tip size so try changing eartips from medium to other size based on your ear I changed to small then I got it fit perfectly in ear"
"I really like the product Premium, Classy and resembles airpods. Am happy with this product .Type c charging is provided which is useful. Must buy earbuds.. Awesome sound effect. Same sound quality as boat headsets. Overall performance is fabulous in this price range and I highly recommend It's is completely worth."
Honest review which no one will tell. Always hiss noise comes from the earbuds which is very irritating.Disconnection happens every now and then if you move a little away.It takes more time to charge fully than as it is mentioned.
Just received these a couple hours ago. I'm not sure if it's a defective product or not cuz the sound quality is just downright horrible. Vocals barely audible at max volume forget about bass. Tried with different phones. IOS and android. They sound the same. HORRIBLE. I've already ordered a replacement. Will update if they're any different.Edit.: received replacement today. Sound exactly the same. I'm perplexed as to how people are praising these and liking how they sound. They're exactly how fake tws sound if not worse. Wouldn't advise anyone to buy this.
Honestly I don't know what to say. I purchased it after reading positive reviews. Even after charging for 6hours it's say low better. Sound quality is average. Changing is a big issue. Waste of money. I had same issue with 1st product I received & requested for replacement. Product which I received after replacement have same issue. I wish if I could give 0 stars. It past the 8days of expected date of pickup but no one came to pick up. Such a unsatisfied customer service.
I am writing this review after 2 months ...Earphone is very cute and light box but after 2 months with occasional use hardly 10 times use the one piece is not charging at all.
I got my Boult Audio Airbass and it arrived in less time than expected the sound quality of this Bolt audio is super cool and the noise cancellation feature is also good that works very fine.the thing that I like the most about this product is that  the battery life of this product is till 24 hour that is more than enough for daily usage.and for the gamers it is Uber cool that it has a less sound latency and you can turn it on whenever you want..
The sound quality is horrible. The reception range is less than 1 metre.  It seems I got cheated on buying this. Now they should return the product and pay back.  I am Amazon pime customer and helpless after buying this.  Amazon should consider to return the product in place of replace.
"I received the product in 1 day, first experience was ok , light weight & good sound etc, but when the battery went low, it can't be charged. If it is not charging how can be used, so I ordered for replacement."

Battery backup is like never seen before on any of the TWS so far, lasted more than 9 hrs on full charge without the case.4. So light that u feel once adjusted, you won't feel itchiness, exact size silicon caps selection plays important role.5. Although case build quality is not upto the mark but fits in any of the jeans coin packet easily.6. Call quality is absolutely so great that the other party couldn't even recognize you're on a headphone unless you're on streets as there is no ANC.Cons:1. All the buds are of plastic glossy feel attract dust and fingerprints.2. The not mentioned gaming mode zero latency that most youtubers blown in their recent reviews is just a gimmick, I didn't even spot any difference between the selections.3. Some pair of buds got mic problem like I'd got with my first pair, but the replacement pair worked fine so far.4. Bass is clear when u make perfect fit silicon straps. Wudve been perfect Basshead, if driver placed near to silicon caps. There is little bit of sound leakage I felt.5. Volume doesn't reach its loudness, need to use sound control apps for horror or some intensive low sound movies if you're watching.Overall a very good budget tws earbud.Thumps up for Amazon's quickest delivery even during this essentials only days! Hats off to all amazon's frontline delivery partners.The replacement also didn't take much of my time."

 Very nice product bass is also nice at this price point and vocals, treble and call quality is very nice. Everything is superb battery life also very nice sound output is also nice no disturbance and distortion. Very nice product. Sound quality also varies with ear size and ear tip size so try changing eartips from medium to other size based on your ear I changed to small then I got it fit perfectly in ear"
"I really like the product Premium, Classy and resembles airpods. Am happy with this product .Type c charging is provided which is useful. Must buy earbuds.. Awesome sound effect. Same sound quality as boat headsets. Overall performance is fabulous in this price range and I highly recommend It's is completely worth."
Honest review which no one will tell. Always hiss noise comes from the earbuds which is very irritating.Disconnection happens every now and then if you move a little away.It takes more time to charge fully than as it is mentioned.
Just received these a couple hours ago. I'm not sure if it's a defective product or not cuz the sound quality is just downright horrible. Vocals barely audible at max volume forget about bass. Tried with different phones. IOS and android. They sound the same. HORRIBLE. I've already ordered a replacement. Will update if they're any different.Edit.: received replacement today. Sound exactly the same. I'm perplexed as to how people are praising these and liking how they sound. They're exactly how fake tws sound if not worse. Wouldn't advise anyone to buy this.
Honestly I don't know what to say. I purchased it after reading positive reviews. Even after charging for 6hours it's say low better. Sound quality is average. Changing is a big issue. Waste of money. I had same issue with 1st product I received & requested for replacement. Product which I received after replacement have same issue. I wish if I could give 0 stars. It past the 8days of expected date of pickup but no one came to pick up. Such a unsatisfied customer service.
I am writing this review after 2 months ...Earphone is very cute and light box but after 2 months with occasional use hardly 10 times use the one piece is not charging at all.
I got my Boult Audio Airbass and it arrived in less time than expected the sound quality of this Bolt audio is super cool and the noise cancellation feature is also good that works very fine.the thing that I like the most about this product is that  the battery life of this product is till 24 hour that is more than enough for daily usage.and for the gamers it is Uber cool that it has a less sound latency and you can turn it on whenever you want..
The sound quality is horrible. The reception range is less than 1 metre.  It seems I got cheated on buying this. Now they should return the product and pay back.  I am Amazon pime customer and helpless after buying this.  Amazon should consider to return the product in place of replace.
"I received the product in 1 day, first experience was ok , light weight & good sound etc, but when the battery went low, it can't be charged. If it is not charging how can be used, so I ordered for replacement."

Battery backup is like never seen before on any of the TWS so far, lasted more than 9 hrs on full charge without the case.4. So light that u feel once adjusted, you won't feel itchiness, exact size silicon caps selection plays important role.5. Although case build quality is not upto the mark but fits in any of the jeans coin packet easily.6. Call quality is absolutely so great that the other party couldn't even recognize you're on a headphone unless you're on streets as there is no ANC.Cons:1. All the buds are of plastic glossy feel attract dust and fingerprints.2. The not mentioned gaming mode zero latency that most youtubers blown in their recent reviews is just a gimmick, I didn't even spot any difference between the selections.3. Some pair of buds got mic problem like I'd got with my first pair, but the replacement pair worked fine so far.4. Bass is clear when u make perfect fit silicon straps. Wudve been perfect Basshead, if driver placed near to silicon caps. There is little bit of sound leakage I felt.5. Volume doesn't reach its loudness, need to use sound control apps for horror or some intensive low sound movies if you're watching.Overall a very good budget tws earbud.Thumps up for Amazon's quickest delivery even during this essentials only days! Hats off to all amazon's frontline delivery partners.The replacement also didn't take much of my time."

 Very nice product bass is also nice at this price point and vocals, treble and call quality is very nice. Everything is superb battery life also very nice sound output is also nice no disturbance and distortion. Very nice product. Sound quality also varies with ear size and ear tip size so try changing eartips from medium to other size based on your ear I changed to small then I got it fit perfectly in ear"
"I really like the product Premium, Classy and resembles airpods. Am happy with this product .Type c charging is provided which is useful. Must buy earbuds.. Awesome sound effect. Same sound quality as boat headsets. Overall performance is fabulous in this price range and I highly recommend It's is completely worth."
Honest review which no one will tell. Always hiss noise comes from the earbuds which is very irritating.Disconnection happens every now and then if you move a little away.It takes more time to charge fully than as it is mentioned.
Just received these a couple hours ago. I'm not sure if it's a defective product or not cuz the sound quality is just downright horrible. Vocals barely audible at max volume forget about bass. Tried with different phones. IOS and android. They sound the same. HORRIBLE. I've already ordered a replacement. Will update if they're any different.Edit.: received replacement today. Sound exactly the same. I'm perplexed as to how people are praising these and liking how they sound. They're exactly how fake tws sound if not worse. Wouldn't advise anyone to buy this.
Honestly I don't know what to say. I purchased it after reading positive reviews. Even after charging for 6hours it's say low better. Sound quality is average. Changing is a big issue. Waste of money. I had same issue with 1st product I received & requested for replacement. Product which I received after replacement have same issue. I wish if I could give 0 stars. It past the 8days of expected date of pickup but no one came to pick up. Such a unsatisfied customer service.
I am writing this review after 2 months ...Earphone is very cute and light box but after 2 months with occasional use hardly 10 times use the one piece is not charging at all.
I got my Boult Audio Airbass and it arrived in less time than expected the sound quality of this Bolt audio is super cool and the noise cancellation feature is also good that works very fine.the thing that I like the most about this product is that  the battery life of this product is till 24 hour that is more than enough for daily usage.and for the gamers it is Uber cool that it has a less sound latency and you can turn it on whenever you want..
The sound quality is horrible. The reception range is less than 1 metre.  It seems I got cheated on buying this. Now they should return the product and pay back.  I am Amazon pime customer and helpless after buying this.  Amazon should consider to return the product in place of replace.
"I received the product in 1 day, first experience was ok , light weight & good sound etc, but when the battery went low, it can't be charged. If it is not charging how can be used, so I ordered for replacement."

Battery backup is like never seen before on any of the TWS so far, lasted more than 9 hrs on full charge without the case.4. So light that u feel once adjusted, you won't feel itchiness, exact size silicon caps selection plays important role.5. Although case build quality is not upto the mark but fits in any of the jeans coin packet easily.6. Call quality is absolutely so great that the other party couldn't even recognize you're on a headphone unless you're on streets as there is no ANC.Cons:1. All the buds are of plastic glossy feel attract dust and fingerprints.2. The not mentioned gaming mode zero latency that most youtubers blown in their recent reviews is just a gimmick, I didn't even spot any difference between the selections.3. Some pair of buds got mic problem like I'd got with my first pair, but the replacement pair worked fine so far.4. Bass is clear when u make perfect fit silicon straps. Wudve been perfect Basshead, if driver placed near to silicon caps. There is little bit of sound leakage I felt.5. Volume doesn't reach its loudness, need to use sound control apps for horror or some intensive low sound movies if you're watching.Overall a very good budget tws earbud.Thumps up for Amazon's quickest delivery even during this essentials only days! Hats off to all amazon's frontline delivery partners.The replacement also didn't take much of my time."

 Very nice product bass is also nice at this price point and vocals, treble and call quality is very nice. Everything is superb battery life also very nice sound output is also nice no disturbance and distortion. Very nice product. Sound quality also varies with ear size and ear tip size so try changing eartips from medium to other size based on your ear I changed to small then I got it fit perfectly in ear"
"I really like the product Premium, Classy and resembles airpods. Am happy with this product .Type c charging is provided which is useful. Must buy earbuds.. Awesome sound effect. Same sound quality as boat headsets. Overall performance is fabulous in this price range and I highly recommend It's is completely worth."
Honest review which no one will tell. Always hiss noise comes from the earbuds which is very irritating.Disconnection happens every now and then if you move a little away.It takes more time to charge fully than as it is mentioned.
Just received these a couple hours ago. I'm not sure if it's a defective product or not cuz the sound quality is just downright horrible. Vocals barely audible at max volume forget about bass. Tried with different phones. IOS and android. They sound the same. HORRIBLE. I've already ordered a replacement. Will update if they're any different.Edit.: received replacement today. Sound exactly the same. I'm perplexed as to how people are praising these and liking how they sound. They're exactly how fake tws sound if not worse. Wouldn't advise anyone to buy this.
Honestly I don't know what to say. I purchased it after reading positive reviews. Even after charging for 6hours it's say low better. Sound quality is average. Changing is a big issue. Waste of money. I had same issue with 1st product I received & requested for replacement. Product which I received after replacement have same issue. I wish if I could give 0 stars. It past the 8days of expected date of pickup but no one came to pick up. Such a unsatisfied customer service.
I am writing this review after 2 months ...Earphone is very cute and light box but after 2 months with occasional use hardly 10 times use the one piece is not charging at all.
I got my Boult Audio Airbass and it arrived in less time than expected the sound quality of this Bolt audio is super cool and the noise cancellation feature is also good that works very fine.the thing that I like the most about this product is that  the battery life of this product is till 24 hour that is more than enough for daily usage.and for the gamers it is Uber cool that it has a less sound latency and you can turn it on whenever you want..
The sound quality is horrible. The reception range is less than 1 metre.  It seems I got cheated on buying this. Now they should return the product and pay back.  I am Amazon pime customer and helpless after buying this.  Amazon should consider to return the product in place of replace.
"I received the product in 1 day, first experience was ok , light weight & good sound etc, but when the battery went low, it can't be charged. If it is not charging how can be used, so I ordered for replacement."

Battery backup is like never seen before on any of the TWS so far, lasted more than 9 hrs on full charge without the case.4. So light that u feel once adjusted, you won't feel itchiness, exact size silicon caps selection plays important role.5. Although case build quality is not upto the mark but fits in any of the jeans coin packet easily.6. Call quality is absolutely so great that the other party couldn't even recognize you're on a headphone unless you're on streets as there is no ANC.Cons:1. All the buds are of plastic glossy feel attract dust and fingerprints.2. The not mentioned gaming mode zero latency that most youtubers blown in their recent reviews is just a gimmick, I didn't even spot any difference between the selections.3. Some pair of buds got mic problem like I'd got with my first pair, but the replacement pair worked fine so far.4. Bass is clear when u make perfect fit silicon straps. Wudve been perfect Basshead, if driver placed near to silicon caps. There is little bit of sound leakage I felt.5. Volume doesn't reach its loudness, need to use sound control apps for horror or some intensive low sound movies if you're watching.Overall a very good budget tws earbud.Thumps up for Amazon's quickest delivery even during this essentials only days! Hats off to all amazon's frontline delivery partners.The replacement also didn't take much of my time."

 Very nice product bass is also nice at this price point and vocals, treble and call quality is very nice. Everything is superb battery life also very nice sound output is also nice no disturbance and distortion. Very nice product. Sound quality also varies with ear size and ear tip size so try changing eartips from medium to other size based on your ear I changed to small then I got it fit perfectly in ear"
"I really like the product Premium, Classy and resembles airpods. Am happy with this product .Type c charging is provided which is useful. Must buy earbuds.. Awesome sound effect. Same sound quality as boat headsets. Overall performance is fabulous in this price range and I highly recommend It's is completely worth."
Honest review which no one will tell. Always hiss noise comes from the earbuds which is very irritating.Disconnection happens every now and then if you move a little away.It takes more time to charge fully than as it is mentioned.
Just received these a couple hours ago. I'm not sure if it's a defective product or not cuz the sound quality is just downright horrible. Vocals barely audible at max volume forget about bass. Tried with different phones. IOS and android. They sound the same. HORRIBLE. I've already ordered a replacement. Will update if they're any different.Edit.: received replacement today. Sound exactly the same. I'm perplexed as to how people are praising these and liking how they sound. They're exactly how fake tws sound if not worse. Wouldn't advise anyone to buy this.
Honestly I don't know what to say. I purchased it after reading positive reviews. Even after charging for 6hours it's say low better. Sound quality is average. Changing is a big issue. Waste of money. I had same issue with 1st product I received & requested for replacement. Product which I received after replacement have same issue. I wish if I could give 0 stars. It past the 8days of expected date of pickup but no one came to pick up. Such a unsatisfied customer service.
I am writing this review after 2 months ...Earphone is very cute and light box but after 2 months with occasional use hardly 10 times use the one piece is not charging at all.
I got my Boult Audio Airbass and it arrived in less time than expected the sound quality of this Bolt audio is super cool and the noise cancellation feature is also good that works very fine.the thing that I like the most about this product is that  the battery life of this product is till 24 hour that is more than enough for daily usage.and for the gamers it is Uber cool that it has a less sound latency and you can turn it on whenever you want..
The sound quality is horrible. The reception range is less than 1 metre.  It seems I got cheated on buying this. Now they should return the product and pay back.  I am Amazon pime customer and helpless after buying this.  Amazon should consider to return the product in place of replace.
"I received the product in 1 day, first experience was ok , light weight & good sound etc, but when the battery went low, it can't be charged. If it is not charging how can be used, so I ordered for replacement."

Battery backup is like never seen before on any of the TWS so far, lasted more than 9 hrs on full charge without the case.4. So light that u feel once adjusted, you won't feel itchiness, exact size silicon caps selection plays important role.5. Although case build quality is not upto the mark but fits in any of the jeans coin packet easily.6. Call quality is absolutely so great that the other party couldn't even recognize you're on a headphone unless you're on streets as there is no ANC.Cons:1. All the buds are of plastic glossy feel attract dust and fingerprints.2. The not mentioned gaming mode zero latency that most youtubers blown in their recent reviews is just a gimmick, I didn't even spot any difference between the selections.3. Some pair of buds got mic problem like I'd got with my first pair, but the replacement pair worked fine so far.4. Bass is clear when u make perfect fit silicon straps. Wudve been perfect Basshead, if driver placed near to silicon caps. There is little bit of sound leakage I felt.5. Volume doesn't reach its loudness, need to use sound control apps for horror or some intensive low sound movies if you're watching.Overall a very good budget tws earbud.Thumps up for Amazon's quickest delivery even during this essentials only days! Hats off to all amazon's frontline delivery partners.The replacement also didn't take much of my time."

 Very nice product bass is also nice at this price point and vocals, treble and call quality is very nice. Everything is superb battery life also very nice sound output is also nice no disturbance and distortion. Very nice product. Sound quality also varies with ear size and ear tip size so try changing eartips from medium to other size based on your ear I changed to small then I got it fit perfectly in ear"
"I really like the product Premium, Classy and resembles airpods. Am happy with this product .Type c charging is provided which is useful. Must buy earbuds.. Awesome sound effect. Same sound quality as boat headsets. Overall performance is fabulous in this price range and I highly recommend It's is completely worth."
Honest review which no one will tell. Always hiss noise comes from the earbuds which is very irritating.Disconnection happens every now and then if you move a little away.It takes more time to charge fully than as it is mentioned.
Just received these a couple hours ago. I'm not sure if it's a defective product or not cuz the sound quality is just downright horrible. Vocals barely audible at max volume forget about bass. Tried with different phones. IOS and android. They sound the same. HORRIBLE. I've already ordered a replacement. Will update if they're any different.Edit.: received replacement today. Sound exactly the same. I'm perplexed as to how people are praising these and liking how they sound. They're exactly how fake tws sound if not worse. Wouldn't advise anyone to buy this.
Honestly I don't know what to say. I purchased it after reading positive reviews. Even after charging for 6hours it's say low better. Sound quality is average. Changing is a big issue. Waste of money. I had same issue with 1st product I received & requested for replacement. Product which I received after replacement have same issue. I wish if I could give 0 stars. It past the 8days of expected date of pickup but no one came to pick up. Such a unsatisfied customer service.
I am writing this review after 2 months ...Earphone is very cute and light box but after 2 months with occasional use hardly 10 times use the one piece is not charging at all.
I got my Boult Audio Airbass and it arrived in less time than expected the sound quality of this Bolt audio is super cool and the noise cancellation feature is also good that works very fine.the thing that I like the most about this product is that  the battery life of this product is till 24 hour that is more than enough for daily usage.and for the gamers it is Uber cool that it has a less sound latency and you can turn it on whenever you want..
The sound quality is horrible. The reception range is less than 1 metre.  It seems I got cheated on buying this. Now they should return the product and pay back.  I am Amazon pime customer and helpless after buying this.  Amazon should consider to return the product in place of replace.
"I received the product in 1 day, first experience was ok , light weight & good sound etc, but when the battery went low, it can't be charged. If it is not charging how can be used, so I ordered for replacement."

Battery backup is like never seen before on any of the TWS so far, lasted more than 9 hrs on full charge without the case.4. So light that u feel once adjusted, you won't feel itchiness, exact size silicon caps selection plays important role.5. Although case build quality is not upto the mark but fits in any of the jeans coin packet easily.6. Call quality is absolutely so great that the other party couldn't even recognize you're on a headphone unless you're on streets as there is no ANC.Cons:1. All the buds are of plastic glossy feel attract dust and fingerprints.2. The not mentioned gaming mode zero latency that most youtubers blown in their recent reviews is just a gimmick, I didn't even spot any difference between the selections.3. Some pair of buds got mic problem like I'd got with my first pair, but the replacement pair worked fine so far.4. Bass is clear when u make perfect fit silicon straps. Wudve been perfect Basshead, if driver placed near to silicon caps. There is little bit of sound leakage I felt.5. Volume doesn't reach its loudness, need to use sound control apps for horror or some intensive low sound movies if you're watching.Overall a very good budget tws earbud.Thumps up for Amazon's quickest delivery even during this essentials only days! Hats off to all amazon's frontline delivery partners.The replacement also didn't take much of my time."

 Very nice product bass is also nice at this price point and vocals, treble and call quality is very nice. Everything is superb battery life also very nice sound output is also nice no disturbance and distortion. Very nice product. Sound quality also varies with ear size and ear tip size so try changing eartips from medium to other size based on your ear I changed to small then I got it fit perfectly in ear"
"I really like the product Premium, Classy and resembles airpods. Am happy with this product .Type c charging is provided which is useful. Must buy earbuds.. Awesome sound effect. Same sound quality as boat headsets. Overall performance is fabulous in this price range and I highly recommend It's is completely worth."
Honest review which no one will tell. Always hiss noise comes from the earbuds which is very irritating.Disconnection happens every now and then if you move a little away.It takes more time to charge fully than as it is mentioned.
Just received these a couple hours ago. I'm not sure if it's a defective product or not cuz the sound quality is just downright horrible. Vocals barely audible at max volume forget about bass. Tried with different phones. IOS and android. They sound the same. HORRIBLE. I've already ordered a replacement. Will update if they're any different.Edit.: received replacement today. Sound exactly the same. I'm perplexed as to how people are praising these and liking how they sound. They're exactly how fake tws sound if not worse. Wouldn't advise anyone to buy this.
Honestly I don't know what to say. I purchased it after reading positive reviews. Even after charging for 6hours it's say low better. Sound quality is average. Changing is a big issue. Waste of money. I had same issue with 1st product I received & requested for replacement. Product which I received after replacement have same issue. I wish if I could give 0 stars. It past the 8days of expected date of pickup but no one came to pick up. Such a unsatisfied customer service.
I am writing this review after 2 months ...Earphone is very cute and light box but after 2 months with occasional use hardly 10 times use the one piece is not charging at all.
I got my Boult Audio Airbass and it arrived in less time than expected the sound quality of this Bolt audio is super cool and the noise cancellation feature is also good that works very fine.the thing that I like the most about this product is that  the battery life of this product is till 24 hour that is more than enough for daily usage.and for the gamers it is Uber cool that it has a less sound latency and you can turn it on whenever you want..
The sound quality is horrible. The reception range is less than 1 metre.  It seems I got cheated on buying this. Now they should return the product and pay back.  I am Amazon pime customer and helpless after buying this.  Amazon should consider to return the product in place of replace.
"I received the product in 1 day, first experience was ok , light weight & good sound etc, but when the battery went low, it can't be charged. If it is not charging how can be used, so I ordered for replacement."

Battery backup is like never seen before on any of the TWS so far, lasted more than 9 hrs on full charge without the case.4. So light that u feel once adjusted, you won't feel itchiness, exact size silicon caps selection plays important role.5. Although case build quality is not upto the mark but fits in any of the jeans coin packet easily.6. Call quality is absolutely so great that the other party couldn't even recognize you're on a headphone unless you're on streets as there is no ANC.Cons:1. All the buds are of plastic glossy feel attract dust and fingerprints.2. The not mentioned gaming mode zero latency that most youtubers blown in their recent reviews is just a gimmick, I didn't even spot any difference between the selections.3. Some pair of buds got mic problem like I'd got with my first pair, but the replacement pair worked fine so far.4. Bass is clear when u make perfect fit silicon straps. Wudve been perfect Basshead, if driver placed near to silicon caps. There is little bit of sound leakage I felt.5. Volume doesn't reach its loudness, need to use sound control apps for horror or some intensive low sound movies if you're watching.Overall a very good budget tws earbud.Thumps up for Amazon's quickest delivery even during this essentials only days! Hats off to all amazon's frontline delivery partners.The replacement also didn't take much of my time."

 Very nice product bass is also nice at this price point and vocals, treble and call quality is very nice. Everything is superb battery life also very nice sound output is also nice no disturbance and distortion. Very nice product. Sound quality also varies with ear size and ear tip size so try changing eartips from medium to other size based on your ear I changed to small then I got it fit perfectly in ear"
"I really like the product Premium, Classy and resembles airpods. Am happy with this product .Type c charging is provided which is useful. Must buy earbuds.. Awesome sound effect. Same sound quality as boat headsets. Overall performance is fabulous in this price range and I highly recommend It's is completely worth."
Honest review which no one will tell. Always hiss noise comes from the earbuds which is very irritating.Disconnection happens every now and then if you move a little away.It takes more time to charge fully than as it is mentioned.
Just received these a couple hours ago. I'm not sure if it's a defective product or not cuz the sound quality is just downright horrible. Vocals barely audible at max volume forget about bass. Tried with different phones. IOS and android. They sound the same. HORRIBLE. I've already ordered a replacement. Will update if they're any different.Edit.: received replacement today. Sound exactly the same. I'm perplexed as to how people are praising these and liking how they sound. They're exactly how fake tws sound if not worse. Wouldn't advise anyone to buy this.
Honestly I don't know what to say. I purchased it after reading positive reviews. Even after charging for 6hours it's say low better. Sound quality is average. Changing is a big issue. Waste of money. I had same issue with 1st product I received & requested for replacement. Product which I received after replacement have same issue. I wish if I could give 0 stars. It past the 8days of expected date of pickup but no one came to pick up. Such a unsatisfied customer service.
I am writing this review after 2 months ...Earphone is very cute and light box but after 2 months with occasional use hardly 10 times use the one piece is not charging at all.
I got my Boult Audio Airbass and it arrived in less time than expected the sound quality of this Bolt audio is super cool and the noise cancellation feature is also good that works very fine.the thing that I like the most about this product is that  the battery life of this product is till 24 hour that is more than enough for daily usage.and for the gamers it is Uber cool that it has a less sound latency and you can turn it on whenever you want..
The sound quality is horrible. The reception range is less than 1 metre.  It seems I got cheated on buying this. Now they should return the product and pay back.  I am Amazon pime customer and helpless after buying this.  Amazon should consider to return the product in place of replace.
"I received the product in 1 day, first experience was ok , light weight & good sound etc, but when the battery went low, it can't be charged. If it is not charging how can be used, so I ordered for replacement."

Battery backup is like never seen before on any of the TWS so far, lasted more than 9 hrs on full charge without the case.4. So light that u feel once adjusted, you won't feel itchiness, exact size silicon caps selection plays important role.5. Although case build quality is not upto the mark but fits in any of the jeans coin packet easily.6. Call quality is absolutely so great that the other party couldn't even recognize you're on a headphone unless you're on streets as there is no ANC.Cons:1. All the buds are of plastic glossy feel attract dust and fingerprints.2. The not mentioned gaming mode zero latency that most youtubers blown in their recent reviews is just a gimmick, I didn't even spot any difference between the selections.3. Some pair of buds got mic problem like I'd got with my first pair, but the replacement pair worked fine so far.4. Bass is clear when u make perfect fit silicon straps. Wudve been perfect Basshead, if driver placed near to silicon caps. There is little bit of sound leakage I felt.5. Volume doesn't reach its loudness, need to use sound control apps for horror or some intensive low sound movies if you're watching.Overall a very good budget tws earbud.Thumps up for Amazon's quickest delivery even during this essentials only days! Hats off to all amazon's frontline delivery partners.The replacement also didn't take much of my time."

 Very nice product bass is also nice at this price point and vocals, treble and call quality is very nice. Everything is superb battery life also very nice sound output is also nice no disturbance and distortion. Very nice product. Sound quality also varies with ear size and ear tip size so try changing eartips from medium to other size based on your ear I changed to small then I got it fit perfectly in ear"
"I really like the product Premium, Classy and resembles airpods. Am happy with this product .Type c charging is provided which is useful. Must buy earbuds.. Awesome sound effect. Same sound quality as boat headsets. Overall performance is fabulous in this price range and I highly recommend It's is completely worth."
Honest review which no one will tell. Always hiss noise comes from the earbuds which is very irritating.Disconnection happens every now and then if you move a little away.It takes more time to charge fully than as it is mentioned.
Just received these a couple hours ago. I'm not sure if it's a defective product or not cuz the sound quality is just downright horrible. Vocals barely audible at max volume forget about bass. Tried with different phones. IOS and android. They sound the same. HORRIBLE. I've already ordered a replacement. Will update if they're any different.Edit.: received replacement today. Sound exactly the same. I'm perplexed as to how people are praising these and liking how they sound. They're exactly how fake tws sound if not worse. Wouldn't advise anyone to buy this.
Honestly I don't know what to say. I purchased it after reading positive reviews. Even after charging for 6hours it's say low better. Sound quality is average. Changing is a big issue. Waste of money. I had same issue with 1st product I received & requested for replacement. Product which I received after replacement have same issue. I wish if I could give 0 stars. It past the 8days of expected date of pickup but no one came to pick up. Such a unsatisfied customer service.
I am writing this review after 2 months ...Earphone is very cute and light box but after 2 months with occasional use hardly 10 times use the one piece is not charging at all.
I got my Boult Audio Airbass and it arrived in less time than expected the sound quality of this Bolt audio is super cool and the noise cancellation feature is also good that works very fine.the thing that I like the most about this product is that  the battery life of this product is till 24 hour that is more than enough for daily usage.and for the gamers it is Uber cool that it has a less sound latency and you can turn it on whenever you want..
The sound quality is horrible. The reception range is less than 1 metre.  It seems I got cheated on buying this. Now they should return the product and pay back.  I am Amazon pime customer and helpless after buying this.  Amazon should consider to return the product in place of replace.
"I received the product in 1 day, first experience was ok , light weight & good sound etc, but when the battery went low, it can't be charged. If it is not charging how can be used, so I ordered for replacement."

Battery backup is like never seen before on any of the TWS so far, lasted more than 9 hrs on full charge without the case.4. So light that u feel once adjusted, you won't feel itchiness, exact size silicon caps selection plays important role.5. Although case build quality is not upto the mark but fits in any of the jeans coin packet easily.6. Call quality is absolutely so great that the other party couldn't even recognize you're on a headphone unless you're on streets as there is no ANC.Cons:1. All the buds are of plastic glossy feel attract dust and fingerprints.2. The not mentioned gaming mode zero latency that most youtubers blown in their recent reviews is just a gimmick, I didn't even spot any difference between the selections.3. Some pair of buds got mic problem like I'd got with my first pair, but the replacement pair worked fine so far.4. Bass is clear when u make perfect fit silicon straps. Wudve been perfect Basshead, if driver placed near to silicon caps. There is little bit of sound leakage I felt.5. Volume doesn't reach its loudness, need to use sound control apps for horror or some intensive low sound movies if you're watching.Overall a very good budget tws earbud.Thumps up for Amazon's quickest delivery even during this essentials only days! Hats off to all amazon's frontline delivery partners.The replacement also didn't take much of my time."

 Very nice product bass is also nice at this price point and vocals, treble and call quality is very nice. Everything is superb battery life also very nice sound output is also nice no disturbance and distortion. Very nice product. Sound quality also varies with ear size and ear tip size so try changing eartips from medium to other size based on your ear I changed to small then I got it fit perfectly in ear"
"I really like the product Premium, Classy and resembles airpods. Am happy with this product .Type c charging is provided which is useful. Must buy earbuds.. Awesome sound effect. Same sound quality as boat headsets. Overall performance is fabulous in this price range and I highly recommend It's is completely worth."
Honest review which no one will tell. Always hiss noise comes from the earbuds which is very irritating.Disconnection happens every now and then if you move a little away.It takes more time to charge fully than as it is mentioned.
Just received these a couple hours ago. I'm not sure if it's a defective product or not cuz the sound quality is just downright horrible. Vocals barely audible at max volume forget about bass. Tried with different phones. IOS and android. They sound the same. HORRIBLE. I've already ordered a replacement. Will update if they're any different.Edit.: received replacement today. Sound exactly the same. I'm perplexed as to how people are praising these and liking how they sound. They're exactly how fake tws sound if not worse. Wouldn't advise anyone to buy this.
Honestly I don't know what to say. I purchased it after reading positive reviews. Even after charging for 6hours it's say low better. Sound quality is average. Changing is a big issue. Waste of money. I had same issue with 1st product I received & requested for replacement. Product which I received after replacement have same issue. I wish if I could give 0 stars. It past the 8days of expected date of pickup but no one came to pick up. Such a unsatisfied customer service.
I am writing this review after 2 months ...Earphone is very cute and light box but after 2 months with occasional use hardly 10 times use the one piece is not charging at all.
I got my Boult Audio Airbass and it arrived in less time than expected the sound quality of this Bolt audio is super cool and the noise cancellation feature is also good that works very fine.the thing that I like the most about this product is that  the battery life of this product is till 24 hour that is more than enough for daily usage.and for the gamers it is Uber cool that it has a less sound latency and you can turn it on whenever you want..
The sound quality is horrible. The reception range is less than 1 metre.  It seems I got cheated on buying this. Now they should return the product and pay back.  I am Amazon pime customer and helpless after buying this.  Amazon should consider to return the product in place of replace.
"I received the product in 1 day, first experience was ok , light weight & good sound etc, but when the battery went low, it can't be charged. If it is not charging how can be used, so I ordered for replacement."

Battery backup is like never seen before on any of the TWS so far, lasted more than 9 hrs on full charge without the case.4. So light that u feel once adjusted, you won't feel itchiness, exact size silicon caps selection plays important role.5. Although case build quality is not upto the mark but fits in any of the jeans coin packet easily.6. Call quality is absolutely so great that the other party couldn't even recognize you're on a headphone unless you're on streets as there is no ANC.Cons:1. All the buds are of plastic glossy feel attract dust and fingerprints.2. The not mentioned gaming mode zero latency that most youtubers blown in their recent reviews is just a gimmick, I didn't even spot any difference between the selections.3. Some pair of buds got mic problem like I'd got with my first pair, but the replacement pair worked fine so far.4. Bass is clear when u make perfect fit silicon straps. Wudve been perfect Basshead, if driver placed near to silicon caps. There is little bit of sound leakage I felt.5. Volume doesn't reach its loudness, need to use sound control apps for horror or some intensive low sound movies if you're watching.Overall a very good budget tws earbud.Thumps up for Amazon's quickest delivery even during this essentials only days! Hats off to all amazon's frontline delivery partners.The replacement also didn't take much of my time."

 Very nice product bass is also nice at this price point and vocals, treble and call quality is very nice. Everything is superb battery life also very nice sound output is also nice no disturbance and distortion. Very nice product. Sound quality also varies with ear size and ear tip size so try changing eartips from medium to other size based on your ear I changed to small then I got it fit perfectly in ear"
"I really like the product Premium, Classy and resembles airpods. Am happy with this product .Type c charging is provided which is useful. Must buy earbuds.. Awesome sound effect. Same sound quality as boat headsets. Overall performance is fabulous in this price range and I highly recommend It's is completely worth."
Honest review which no one will tell. Always hiss noise comes from the earbuds which is very irritating.Disconnection happens every now and then if you move a little away.It takes more time to charge fully than as it is mentioned.
Just received these a couple hours ago. I'm not sure if it's a defective product or not cuz the sound quality is just downright horrible. Vocals barely audible at max volume forget about bass. Tried with different phones. IOS and android. They sound the same. HORRIBLE. I've already ordered a replacement. Will update if they're any different.Edit.: received replacement today. Sound exactly the same. I'm perplexed as to how people are praising these and liking how they sound. They're exactly how fake tws sound if not worse. Wouldn't advise anyone to buy this.
Honestly I don't know what to say. I purchased it after reading positive reviews. Even after charging for 6hours it's say low better. Sound quality is average. Changing is a big issue. Waste of money. I had same issue with 1st product I received & requested for replacement. Product which I received after replacement have same issue. I wish if I could give 0 stars. It past the 8days of expected date of pickup but no one came to pick up. Such a unsatisfied customer service.
I am writing this review after 2 months ...Earphone is very cute and light box but after 2 months with occasional use hardly 10 times use the one piece is not charging at all.
I got my Boult Audio Airbass and it arrived in less time than expected the sound quality of this Bolt audio is super cool and the noise cancellation feature is also good that works very fine.the thing that I like the most about this product is that  the battery life of this product is till 24 hour that is more than enough for daily usage.and for the gamers it is Uber cool that it has a less sound latency and you can turn it on whenever you want..
The sound quality is horrible. The reception range is less than 1 metre.  It seems I got cheated on buying this. Now they should return the product and pay back.  I am Amazon pime customer and helpless after buying this.  Amazon should consider to return the product in place of replace.
"I received the product in 1 day, first experience was ok , light weight & good sound etc, but when the battery went low, it can't be charged. If it is not charging how can be used, so I ordered for replacement."

Battery backup is like never seen before on any of the TWS so far, lasted more than 9 hrs on full charge without the case.4. So light that u feel once adjusted, you won't feel itchiness, exact size silicon caps selection plays important role.5. Although case build quality is not upto the mark but fits in any of the jeans coin packet easily.6. Call quality is absolutely so great that the other party couldn't even recognize you're on a headphone unless you're on streets as there is no ANC.Cons:1. All the buds are of plastic glossy feel attract dust and fingerprints.2. The not mentioned gaming mode zero latency that most youtubers blown in their recent reviews is just a gimmick, I didn't even spot any difference between the selections.3. Some pair of buds got mic problem like I'd got with my first pair, but the replacement pair worked fine so far.4. Bass is clear when u make perfect fit silicon straps. Wudve been perfect Basshead, if driver placed near to silicon caps. There is little bit of sound leakage I felt.5. Volume doesn't reach its loudness, need to use sound control apps for horror or some intensive low sound movies if you're watching.Overall a very good budget tws earbud.Thumps up for Amazon's quickest delivery even during this essentials only days! Hats off to all amazon's frontline delivery partners.The replacement also didn't take much of my time."

 Very nice product bass is also nice at this price point and vocals, treble and call quality is very nice. Everything is superb battery life also very nice sound output is also nice no disturbance and distortion. Very nice product. Sound quality also varies with ear size and ear tip size so try changing eartips from medium to other size based on your ear I changed to small then I got it fit perfectly in ear"
"I really like the product Premium, Classy and resembles airpods. Am happy with this product .Type c charging is provided which is useful. Must buy earbuds.. Awesome sound effect. Same sound quality as boat headsets. Overall performance is fabulous in this price range and I highly recommend It's is completely worth."
Honest review which no one will tell. Always hiss noise comes from the earbuds which is very irritating.Disconnection happens every now and then if you move a little away.It takes more time to charge fully than as it is mentioned.
Just received these a couple hours ago. I'm not sure if it's a defective product or not cuz the sound quality is just downright horrible. Vocals barely audible at max volume forget about bass. Tried with different phones. IOS and android. They sound the same. HORRIBLE. I've already ordered a replacement. Will update if they're any different.Edit.: received replacement today. Sound exactly the same. I'm perplexed as to how people are praising these and liking how they sound. They're exactly how fake tws sound if not worse. Wouldn't advise anyone to buy this.
Honestly I don't know what to say. I purchased it after reading positive reviews. Even after charging for 6hours it's say low better. Sound quality is average. Changing is a big issue. Waste of money. I had same issue with 1st product I received & requested for replacement. Product which I received after replacement have same issue. I wish if I could give 0 stars. It past the 8days of expected date of pickup but no one came to pick up. Such a unsatisfied customer service.
I am writing this review after 2 months ...Earphone is very cute and light box but after 2 months with occasional use hardly 10 times use the one piece is not charging at all.
I got my Boult Audio Airbass and it arrived in less time than expected the sound quality of this Bolt audio is super cool and the noise cancellation feature is also good that works very fine.the thing that I like the most about this product is that  the battery life of this product is till 24 hour that is more than enough for daily usage.and for the gamers it is Uber cool that it has a less sound latency and you can turn it on whenever you want..
The sound quality is horrible. The reception range is less than 1 metre.  It seems I got cheated on buying this. Now they should return the product and pay back.  I am Amazon pime customer and helpless after buying this.  Amazon should consider to return the product in place of replace.
"I received the product in 1 day, first experience was ok , light weight & good sound etc, but when the battery went low, it can't be charged. If it is not charging how can be used, so I ordered for replacement."

Battery backup is like never seen before on any of the TWS so far, lasted more than 9 hrs on full charge without the case.4. So light that u feel once adjusted, you won't feel itchiness, exact size silicon caps selection plays important role.5. Although case build quality is not upto the mark but fits in any of the jeans coin packet easily.6. Call quality is absolutely so great that the other party couldn't even recognize you're on a headphone unless you're on streets as there is no ANC.Cons:1. All the buds are of plastic glossy feel attract dust and fingerprints.2. The not mentioned gaming mode zero latency that most youtubers blown in their recent reviews is just a gimmick, I didn't even spot any difference between the selections.3. Some pair of buds got mic problem like I'd got with my first pair, but the replacement pair worked fine so far.4. Bass is clear when u make perfect fit silicon straps. Wudve been perfect Basshead, if driver placed near to silicon caps. There is little bit of sound leakage I felt.5. Volume doesn't reach its loudness, need to use sound control apps for horror or some intensive low sound movies if you're watching.Overall a very good budget tws earbud.Thumps up for Amazon's quickest delivery even during this essentials only days! Hats off to all amazon's frontline delivery partners.The replacement also didn't take much of my time."

 Very nice product bass is also nice at this price point and vocals, treble and call quality is very nice. Everything is superb battery life also very nice sound output is also nice no disturbance and distortion. Very nice product. Sound quality also varies with ear size and ear tip size so try changing eartips from medium to other size based on your ear I changed to small then I got it fit perfectly in ear"
"I really like the product Premium, Classy and resembles airpods. Am happy with this product .Type c charging is provided which is useful. Must buy earbuds.. Awesome sound effect. Same sound quality as boat headsets. Overall performance is fabulous in this price range and I highly recommend It's is completely worth."
Honest review which no one will tell. Always hiss noise comes from the earbuds which is very irritating.Disconnection happens every now and then if you move a little away.It takes more time to charge fully than as it is mentioned.
Just received these a couple hours ago. I'm not sure if it's a defective product or not cuz the sound quality is just downright horrible. Vocals barely audible at max volume forget about bass. Tried with different phones. IOS and android. They sound the same. HORRIBLE. I've already ordered a replacement. Will update if they're any different.Edit.: received replacement today. Sound exactly the same. I'm perplexed as to how people are praising these and liking how they sound. They're exactly how fake tws sound if not worse. Wouldn't advise anyone to buy this.
Honestly I don't know what to say. I purchased it after reading positive reviews. Even after charging for 6hours it's say low better. Sound quality is average. Changing is a big issue. Waste of money. I had same issue with 1st product I received & requested for replacement. Product which I received after replacement have same issue. I wish if I could give 0 stars. It past the 8days of expected date of pickup but no one came to pick up. Such a unsatisfied customer service.
I am writing this review after 2 months ...Earphone is very cute and light box but after 2 months with occasional use hardly 10 times use the one piece is not charging at all.
I got my Boult Audio Airbass and it arrived in less time than expected the sound quality of this Bolt audio is super cool and the noise cancellation feature is also good that works very fine.the thing that I like the most about this product is that  the battery life of this product is till 24 hour that is more than enough for daily usage.and for the gamers it is Uber cool that it has a less sound latency and you can turn it on whenever you want..
The sound quality is horrible. The reception range is less than 1 metre.  It seems I got cheated on buying this. Now they should return the product and pay back.  I am Amazon pime customer and helpless after buying this.  Amazon should consider to return the product in place of replace.
"I received the product in 1 day, first experience was ok , light weight & good sound etc, but when the battery went low, it can't be charged. If it is not charging how can be used, so I ordered for replacement."

Battery backup is like never seen before on any of the TWS so far, lasted more than 9 hrs on full charge without the case.4. So light that u feel once adjusted, you won't feel itchiness, exact size silicon caps selection plays important role.5. Although case build quality is not upto the mark but fits in any of the jeans coin packet easily.6. Call quality is absolutely so great that the other party couldn't even recognize you're on a headphone unless you're on streets as there is no ANC.Cons:1. All the buds are of plastic glossy feel attract dust and fingerprints.2. The not mentioned gaming mode zero latency that most youtubers blown in their recent reviews is just a gimmick, I didn't even spot any difference between the selections.3. Some pair of buds got mic problem like I'd got with my first pair, but the replacement pair worked fine so far.4. Bass is clear when u make perfect fit silicon straps. Wudve been perfect Basshead, if driver placed near to silicon caps. There is little bit of sound leakage I felt.5. Volume doesn't reach its loudness, need to use sound control apps for horror or some intensive low sound movies if you're watching.Overall a very good budget tws earbud.Thumps up for Amazon's quickest delivery even during this essentials only days! Hats off to all amazon's frontline delivery partners.The replacement also didn't take much of my time."

 Very nice product bass is also nice at this price point and vocals, treble and call quality is very nice. Everything is superb battery life also very nice sound output is also nice no disturbance and distortion. Very nice product. Sound quality also varies with ear size and ear tip size so try changing eartips from medium to other size based on your ear I changed to small then I got it fit perfectly in ear"
"I really like the product Premium, Classy and resembles airpods. Am happy with this product .Type c charging is provided which is useful. Must buy earbuds.. Awesome sound effect. Same sound quality as boat headsets. Overall performance is fabulous in this price range and I highly recommend It's is completely worth."
Honest review which no one will tell. Always hiss noise comes from the earbuds which is very irritating.Disconnection happens every now and then if you move a little away.It takes more time to charge fully than as it is mentioned.
Just received these a couple hours ago. I'm not sure if it's a defective product or not cuz the sound quality is just downright horrible. Vocals barely audible at max volume forget about bass. Tried with different phones. IOS and android. They sound the same. HORRIBLE. I've already ordered a replacement. Will update if they're any different.Edit.: received replacement today. Sound exactly the same. I'm perplexed as to how people are praising these and liking how they sound. They're exactly how fake tws sound if not worse. Wouldn't advise anyone to buy this.
Honestly I don't know what to say. I purchased it after reading positive reviews. Even after charging for 6hours it's say low better. Sound quality is average. Changing is a big issue. Waste of money. I had same issue with 1st product I received & requested for replacement. Product which I received after replacement have same issue. I wish if I could give 0 stars. It past the 8days of expected date of pickup but no one came to pick up. Such a unsatisfied customer service.
I am writing this review after 2 months ...Earphone is very cute and light box but after 2 months with occasional use hardly 10 times use the one piece is not charging at all.
I got my Boult Audio Airbass and it arrived in less time than expected the sound quality of this Bolt audio is super cool and the noise cancellation feature is also good that works very fine.the thing that I like the most about this product is that  the battery life of this product is till 24 hour that is more than enough for daily usage.and for the gamers it is Uber cool that it has a less sound latency and you can turn it on whenever you want..
The sound quality is horrible. The reception range is less than 1 metre.  It seems I got cheated on buying this. Now they should return the product and pay back.  I am Amazon pime customer and helpless after buying this.  Amazon should consider to return the product in place of replace.
"I received the product in 1 day, first experience was ok , light weight & good sound etc, but when the battery went low, it can't be charged. If it is not charging how can be used, so I ordered for replacement."

Battery backup is like never seen before on any of the TWS so far, lasted more than 9 hrs on full charge without the case.4. So light that u feel once adjusted, you won't feel itchiness, exact size silicon caps selection plays important role.5. Although case build quality is not upto the mark but fits in any of the jeans coin packet easily.6. Call quality is absolutely so great that the other party couldn't even recognize you're on a headphone unless you're on streets as there is no ANC.Cons:1. All the buds are of plastic glossy feel attract dust and fingerprints.2. The not mentioned gaming mode zero latency that most youtubers blown in their recent reviews is just a gimmick, I didn't even spot any difference between the selections.3. Some pair of buds got mic problem like I'd got with my first pair, but the replacement pair worked fine so far.4. Bass is clear when u make perfect fit silicon straps. Wudve been perfect Basshead, if driver placed near to silicon caps. There is little bit of sound leakage I felt.5. Volume doesn't reach its loudness, need to use sound control apps for horror or some intensive low sound movies if you're watching.Overall a very good budget tws earbud.Thumps up for Amazon's quickest delivery even during this essentials only days! Hats off to all amazon's frontline delivery partners.The replacement also didn't take much of my time."

 Very nice product bass is also nice at this price point and vocals, treble and call quality is very nice. Everything is superb battery life also very nice sound output is also nice no disturbance and distortion. Very nice product. Sound quality also varies with ear size and ear tip size so try changing eartips from medium to other size based on your ear I changed to small then I got it fit perfectly in ear"
"I really like the product Premium, Classy and resembles airpods. Am happy with this product .Type c charging is provided which is useful. Must buy earbuds.. Awesome sound effect. Same sound quality as boat headsets. Overall performance is fabulous in this price range and I highly recommend It's is completely worth."
Honest review which no one will tell. Always hiss noise comes from the earbuds which is very irritating.Disconnection happens every now and then if you move a little away.It takes more time to charge fully than as it is mentioned.
Just received these a couple hours ago. I'm not sure if it's a defective product or not cuz the sound quality is just downright horrible. Vocals barely audible at max volume forget about bass. Tried with different phones. IOS and android. They sound the same. HORRIBLE. I've already ordered a replacement. Will update if they're any different.Edit.: received replacement today. Sound exactly the same. I'm perplexed as to how people are praising these and liking how they sound. They're exactly how fake tws sound if not worse. Wouldn't advise anyone to buy this.
Honestly I don't know what to say. I purchased it after reading positive reviews. Even after charging for 6hours it's say low better. Sound quality is average. Changing is a big issue. Waste of money. I had same issue with 1st product I received & requested for replacement. Product which I received after replacement have same issue. I wish if I could give 0 stars. It past the 8days of expected date of pickup but no one came to pick up. Such a unsatisfied customer service.
I am writing this review after 2 months ...Earphone is very cute and light box but after 2 months with occasional use hardly 10 times use the one piece is not charging at all.
I got my Boult Audio Airbass and it arrived in less time than expected the sound quality of this Bolt audio is super cool and the noise cancellation feature is also good that works very fine.the thing that I like the most about this product is that  the battery life of this product is till 24 hour that is more than enough for daily usage.and for the gamers it is Uber cool that it has a less sound latency and you can turn it on whenever you want..
The sound quality is horrible. The reception range is less than 1 metre.  It seems I got cheated on buying this. Now they should return the product and pay back.  I am Amazon pime customer and helpless after buying this.  Amazon should consider to return the product in place of replace.
"I received the product in 1 day, first experience was ok , light weight & good sound etc, but when the battery went low, it can't be charged. If it is not charging how can be used, so I ordered for replacement."

Battery backup is like never seen before on any of the TWS so far, lasted more than 9 hrs on full charge without the case.4. So light that u feel once adjusted, you won't feel itchiness, exact size silicon caps selection plays important role.5. Although case build quality is not upto the mark but fits in any of the jeans coin packet easily.6. Call quality is absolutely so great that the other party couldn't even recognize you're on a headphone unless you're on streets as there is no ANC.Cons:1. All the buds are of plastic glossy feel attract dust and fingerprints.2. The not mentioned gaming mode zero latency that most youtubers blown in their recent reviews is just a gimmick, I didn't even spot any difference between the selections.3. Some pair of buds got mic problem like I'd got with my first pair, but the replacement pair worked fine so far.4. Bass is clear when u make perfect fit silicon straps. Wudve been perfect Basshead, if driver placed near to silicon caps. There is little bit of sound leakage I felt.5. Volume doesn't reach its loudness, need to use sound control apps for horror or some intensive low sound movies if you're watching.Overall a very good budget tws earbud.Thumps up for Amazon's quickest delivery even during this essentials only days! Hats off to all amazon's frontline delivery partners.The replacement also didn't take much of my time."

 Very nice product bass is also nice at this price point and vocals, treble and call quality is very nice. Everything is superb battery life also very nice sound output is also nice no disturbance and distortion. Very nice product. Sound quality also varies with ear size and ear tip size so try changing eartips from medium to other size based on your ear I changed to small then I got it fit perfectly in ear"
"I really like the product Premium, Classy and resembles airpods. Am happy with this product .Type c charging is provided which is useful. Must buy earbuds.. Awesome sound effect. Same sound quality as boat headsets. Overall performance is fabulous in this price range and I highly recommend It's is completely worth."
Honest review which no one will tell. Always hiss noise comes from the earbuds which is very irritating.Disconnection happens every now and then if you move a little away.It takes more time to charge fully than as it is mentioned.
Just received these a couple hours ago. I'm not sure if it's a defective product or not cuz the sound quality is just downright horrible. Vocals barely audible at max volume forget about bass. Tried with different phones. IOS and android. They sound the same. HORRIBLE. I've already ordered a replacement. Will update if they're any different.Edit.: received replacement today. Sound exactly the same. I'm perplexed as to how people are praising these and liking how they sound. They're exactly how fake tws sound if not worse. Wouldn't advise anyone to buy this.
Honestly I don't know what to say. I purchased it after reading positive reviews. Even after charging for 6hours it's say low better. Sound quality is average. Changing is a big issue. Waste of money. I had same issue with 1st product I received & requested for replacement. Product which I received after replacement have same issue. I wish if I could give 0 stars. It past the 8days of expected date of pickup but no one came to pick up. Such a unsatisfied customer service.
I am writing this review after 2 months ...Earphone is very cute and light box but after 2 months with occasional use hardly 10 times use the one piece is not charging at all.
I got my Boult Audio Airbass and it arrived in less time than expected the sound quality of this Bolt audio is super cool and the noise cancellation feature is also good that works very fine.the thing that I like the most about this product is that  the battery life of this product is till 24 hour that is more than enough for daily usage.and for the gamers it is Uber cool that it has a less sound latency and you can turn it on whenever you want..
The sound quality is horrible. The reception range is less than 1 metre.  It seems I got cheated on buying this. Now they should return the product and pay back.  I am Amazon pime customer and helpless after buying this.  Amazon should consider to return the product in place of replace.
"I received the product in 1 day, first experience was ok , light weight & good sound etc, but when the battery went low, it can't be charged. If it is not charging how can be used, so I ordered for replacement."

Battery backup is like never seen before on any of the TWS so far, lasted more than 9 hrs on full charge without the case.4. So light that u feel once adjusted, you won't feel itchiness, exact size silicon caps selection plays important role.5. Although case build quality is not upto the mark but fits in any of the jeans coin packet easily.6. Call quality is absolutely so great that the other party couldn't even recognize you're on a headphone unless you're on streets as there is no ANC.Cons:1. All the buds are of plastic glossy feel attract dust and fingerprints.2. The not mentioned gaming mode zero latency that most youtubers blown in their recent reviews is just a gimmick, I didn't even spot any difference between the selections.3. Some pair of buds got mic problem like I'd got with my first pair, but the replacement pair worked fine so far.4. Bass is clear when u make perfect fit silicon straps. Wudve been perfect Basshead, if driver placed near to silicon caps. There is little bit of sound leakage I felt.5. Volume doesn't reach its loudness, need to use sound control apps for horror or some intensive low sound movies if you're watching.Overall a very good budget tws earbud.Thumps up for Amazon's quickest delivery even during this essentials only days! Hats off to all amazon's frontline delivery partners.The replacement also didn't take much of my time."

 Very nice product bass is also nice at this price point and vocals, treble and call quality is very nice. Everything is superb battery life also very nice sound output is also nice no disturbance and distortion. Very nice product. Sound quality also varies with ear size and ear tip size so try changing eartips from medium to other size based on your ear I changed to small then I got it fit perfectly in ear"
"I really like the product Premium, Classy and resembles airpods. Am happy with this product .Type c charging is provided which is useful. Must buy earbuds.. Awesome sound effect. Same sound quality as boat headsets. Overall performance is fabulous in this price range and I highly recommend It's is completely worth."
Honest review which no one will tell. Always hiss noise comes from the earbuds which is very irritating.Disconnection happens every now and then if you move a little away.It takes more time to charge fully than as it is mentioned.
Just received these a couple hours ago. I'm not sure if it's a defective product or not cuz the sound quality is just downright horrible. Vocals barely audible at max volume forget about bass. Tried with different phones. IOS and android. They sound the same. HORRIBLE. I've already ordered a replacement. Will update if they're any different.Edit.: received replacement today. Sound exactly the same. I'm perplexed as to how people are praising these and liking how they sound. They're exactly how fake tws sound if not worse. Wouldn't advise anyone to buy this.
Honestly I don't know what to say. I purchased it after reading positive reviews. Even after charging for 6hours it's say low better. Sound quality is average. Changing is a big issue. Waste of money. I had same issue with 1st product I received & requested for replacement. Product which I received after replacement have same issue. I wish if I could give 0 stars. It past the 8days of expected date of pickup but no one came to pick up. Such a unsatisfied customer service.
I am writing this review after 2 months ...Earphone is very cute and light box but after 2 months with occasional use hardly 10 times use the one piece is not charging at all.
I got my Boult Audio Airbass and it arrived in less time than expected the sound quality of this Bolt audio is super cool and the noise cancellation feature is also good that works very fine.the thing that I like the most about this product is that  the battery life of this product is till 24 hour that is more than enough for daily usage.and for the gamers it is Uber cool that it has a less sound latency and you can turn it on whenever you want..
The sound quality is horrible. The reception range is less than 1 metre.  It seems I got cheated on buying this. Now they should return the product and pay back.  I am Amazon pime customer and helpless after buying this.  Amazon should consider to return the product in place of replace.
"I received the product in 1 day, first experience was ok , light weight & good sound etc, but when the battery went low, it can't be charged. If it is not charging how can be used, so I ordered for replacement."

Battery backup is like never seen before on any of the TWS so far, lasted more than 9 hrs on full charge without the case.4. So light that u feel once adjusted, you won't feel itchiness, exact size silicon caps selection plays important role.5. Although case build quality is not upto the mark but fits in any of the jeans coin packet easily.6. Call quality is absolutely so great that the other party couldn't even recognize you're on a headphone unless you're on streets as there is no ANC.Cons:1. All the buds are of plastic glossy feel attract dust and fingerprints.2. The not mentioned gaming mode zero latency that most youtubers blown in their recent reviews is just a gimmick, I didn't even spot any difference between the selections.3. Some pair of buds got mic problem like I'd got with my first pair, but the replacement pair worked fine so far.4. Bass is clear when u make perfect fit silicon straps. Wudve been perfect Basshead, if driver placed near to silicon caps. There is little bit of sound leakage I felt.5. Volume doesn't reach its loudness, need to use sound control apps for horror or some intensive low sound movies if you're watching.Overall a very good budget tws earbud.Thumps up for Amazon's quickest delivery even during this essentials only days! Hats off to all amazon's frontline delivery partners.The replacement also didn't take much of my time."

 Very nice product bass is also nice at this price point and vocals, treble and call quality is very nice. Everything is superb battery life also very nice sound output is also nice no disturbance and distortion. Very nice product. Sound quality also varies with ear size and ear tip size so try changing eartips from medium to other size based on your ear I changed to small then I got it fit perfectly in ear"
"I really like the product Premium, Classy and resembles airpods. Am happy with this product .Type c charging is provided which is useful. Must buy earbuds.. Awesome sound effect. Same sound quality as boat headsets. Overall performance is fabulous in this price range and I highly recommend It's is completely worth."
Honest review which no one will tell. Always hiss noise comes from the earbuds which is very irritating.Disconnection happens every now and then if you move a little away.It takes more time to charge fully than as it is mentioned.
Just received these a couple hours ago. I'm not sure if it's a defective product or not cuz the sound quality is just downright horrible. Vocals barely audible at max volume forget about bass. Tried with different phones. IOS and android. They sound the same. HORRIBLE. I've already ordered a replacement. Will update if they're any different.Edit.: received replacement today. Sound exactly the same. I'm perplexed as to how people are praising these and liking how they sound. They're exactly how fake tws sound if not worse. Wouldn't advise anyone to buy this.
Honestly I don't know what to say. I purchased it after reading positive reviews. Even after charging for 6hours it's say low better. Sound quality is average. Changing is a big issue. Waste of money. I had same issue with 1st product I received & requested for replacement. Product which I received after replacement have same issue. I wish if I could give 0 stars. It past the 8days of expected date of pickup but no one came to pick up. Such a unsatisfied customer service.
I am writing this review after 2 months ...Earphone is very cute and light box but after 2 months with occasional use hardly 10 times use the one piece is not charging at all.
I got my Boult Audio Airbass and it arrived in less time than expected the sound quality of this Bolt audio is super cool and the noise cancellation feature is also good that works very fine.the thing that I like the most about this product is that  the battery life of this product is till 24 hour that is more than enough for daily usage.and for the gamers it is Uber cool that it has a less sound latency and you can turn it on whenever you want..
The sound quality is horrible. The reception range is less than 1 metre.  It seems I got cheated on buying this. Now they should return the product and pay back.  I am Amazon pime customer and helpless after buying this.  Amazon should consider to return the product in place of replace.
"I received the product in 1 day, first experience was ok , light weight & good sound etc, but when the battery went low, it can't be charged. If it is not charging how can be used, so I ordered for replacement."

Battery backup is like never seen before on any of the TWS so far, lasted more than 9 hrs on full charge without the case.4. So light that u feel once adjusted, you won't feel itchiness, exact size silicon caps selection plays important role.5. Although case build quality is not upto the mark but fits in any of the jeans coin packet easily.6. Call quality is absolutely so great that the other party couldn't even recognize you're on a headphone unless you're on streets as there is no ANC.Cons:1. All the buds are of plastic glossy feel attract dust and fingerprints.2. The not mentioned gaming mode zero latency that most youtubers blown in their recent reviews is just a gimmick, I didn't even spot any difference between the selections.3. Some pair of buds got mic problem like I'd got with my first pair, but the replacement pair worked fine so far.4. Bass is clear when u make perfect fit silicon straps. Wudve been perfect Basshead, if driver placed near to silicon caps. There is little bit of sound leakage I felt.5. Volume doesn't reach its loudness, need to use sound control apps for horror or some intensive low sound movies if you're watching.Overall a very good budget tws earbud.Thumps up for Amazon's quickest delivery even during this essentials only days! Hats off to all amazon's frontline delivery partners.The replacement also didn't take much of my time."

 Very nice product bass is also nice at this price point and vocals, treble and call quality is very nice. Everything is superb battery life also very nice sound output is also nice no disturbance and distortion. Very nice product. Sound quality also varies with ear size and ear tip size so try changing eartips from medium to other size based on your ear I changed to small then I got it fit perfectly in ear"
"I really like the product Premium, Classy and resembles airpods. Am happy with this product .Type c charging is provided which is useful. Must buy earbuds.. Awesome sound effect. Same sound quality as boat headsets. Overall performance is fabulous in this price range and I highly recommend It's is completely worth."
Honest review which no one will tell. Always hiss noise comes from the earbuds which is very irritating.Disconnection happens every now and then if you move a little away.It takes more time to charge fully than as it is mentioned.
Just received these a couple hours ago. I'm not sure if it's a defective product or not cuz the sound quality is just downright horrible. Vocals barely audible at max volume forget about bass. Tried with different phones. IOS and android. They sound the same. HORRIBLE. I've already ordered a replacement. Will update if they're any different.Edit.: received replacement today. Sound exactly the same. I'm perplexed as to how people are praising these and liking how they sound. They're exactly how fake tws sound if not worse. Wouldn't advise anyone to buy this.
Honestly I don't know what to say. I purchased it after reading positive reviews. Even after charging for 6hours it's say low better. Sound quality is average. Changing is a big issue. Waste of money. I had same issue with 1st product I received & requested for replacement. Product which I received after replacement have same issue. I wish if I could give 0 stars. It past the 8days of expected date of pickup but no one came to pick up. Such a unsatisfied customer service.
I am writing this review after 2 months ...Earphone is very cute and light box but after 2 months with occasional use hardly 10 times use the one piece is not charging at all.
I got my Boult Audio Airbass and it arrived in less time than expected the sound quality of this Bolt audio is super cool and the noise cancellation feature is also good that works very fine.the thing that I like the most about this product is that  the battery life of this product is till 24 hour that is more than enough for daily usage.and for the gamers it is Uber cool that it has a less sound latency and you can turn it on whenever you want..
The sound quality is horrible. The reception range is less than 1 metre.  It seems I got cheated on buying this. Now they should return the product and pay back.  I am Amazon pime customer and helpless after buying this.  Amazon should consider to return the product in place of replace.
"I received the product in 1 day, first experience was ok , light weight & good sound etc, but when the battery went low, it can't be charged. If it is not charging how can be used, so I ordered for replacement."

Battery backup is like never seen before on any of the TWS so far, lasted more than 9 hrs on full charge without the case.4. So light that u feel once adjusted, you won't feel itchiness, exact size silicon caps selection plays important role.5. Although case build quality is not upto the mark but fits in any of the jeans coin packet easily.6. Call quality is absolutely so great that the other party couldn't even recognize you're on a headphone unless you're on streets as there is no ANC.Cons:1. All the buds are of plastic glossy feel attract dust and fingerprints.2. The not mentioned gaming mode zero latency that most youtubers blown in their recent reviews is just a gimmick, I didn't even spot any difference between the selections.3. Some pair of buds got mic problem like I'd got with my first pair, but the replacement pair worked fine so far.4. Bass is clear when u make perfect fit silicon straps. Wudve been perfect Basshead, if driver placed near to silicon caps. There is little bit of sound leakage I felt.5. Volume doesn't reach its loudness, need to use sound control apps for horror or some intensive low sound movies if you're watching.Overall a very good budget tws earbud.Thumps up for Amazon's quickest delivery even during this essentials only days! Hats off to all amazon's frontline delivery partners.The replacement also didn't take much of my time."

 Very nice product bass is also nice at this price point and vocals, treble and call quality is very nice. Everything is superb battery life also very nice sound output is also nice no disturbance and distortion. Very nice product. Sound quality also varies with ear size and ear tip size so try changing eartips from medium to other size based on your ear I changed to small then I got it fit perfectly in ear"
"I really like the product Premium, Classy and resembles airpods. Am happy with this product .Type c charging is provided which is useful. Must buy earbuds.. Awesome sound effect. Same sound quality as boat headsets. Overall performance is fabulous in this price range and I highly recommend It's is completely worth."
Honest review which no one will tell. Always hiss noise comes from the earbuds which is very irritating.Disconnection happens every now and then if you move a little away.It takes more time to charge fully than as it is mentioned.
Just received these a couple hours ago. I'm not sure if it's a defective product or not cuz the sound quality is just downright horrible. Vocals barely audible at max volume forget about bass. Tried with different phones. IOS and android. They sound the same. HORRIBLE. I've already ordered a replacement. Will update if they're any different.Edit.: received replacement today. Sound exactly the same. I'm perplexed as to how people are praising these and liking how they sound. They're exactly how fake tws sound if not worse. Wouldn't advise anyone to buy this.
Honestly I don't know what to say. I purchased it after reading positive reviews. Even after charging for 6hours it's say low better. Sound quality is average. Changing is a big issue. Waste of money. I had same issue with 1st product I received & requested for replacement. Product which I received after replacement have same issue. I wish if I could give 0 stars. It past the 8days of expected date of pickup but no one came to pick up. Such a unsatisfied customer service.
I am writing this review after 2 months ...Earphone is very cute and light box but after 2 months with occasional use hardly 10 times use the one piece is not charging at all.
I got my Boult Audio Airbass and it arrived in less time than expected the sound quality of this Bolt audio is super cool and the noise cancellation feature is also good that works very fine.the thing that I like the most about this product is that  the battery life of this product is till 24 hour that is more than enough for daily usage.and for the gamers it is Uber cool that it has a less sound latency and you can turn it on whenever you want..
The sound quality is horrible. The reception range is less than 1 metre.  It seems I got cheated on buying this. Now they should return the product and pay back.  I am Amazon pime customer and helpless after buying this.  Amazon should consider to return the product in place of replace.
"I received the product in 1 day, first experience was ok , light weight & good sound etc, but when the battery went low, it can't be charged. If it is not charging how can be used, so I ordered for replacement."

Battery backup is like never seen before on any of the TWS so far, lasted more than 9 hrs on full charge without the case.4. So light that u feel once adjusted, you won't feel itchiness, exact size silicon caps selection plays important role.5. Although case build quality is not upto the mark but fits in any of the jeans coin packet easily.6. Call quality is absolutely so great that the other party couldn't even recognize you're on a headphone unless you're on streets as there is no ANC.Cons:1. All the buds are of plastic glossy feel attract dust and fingerprints.2. The not mentioned gaming mode zero latency that most youtubers blown in their recent reviews is just a gimmick, I didn't even spot any difference between the selections.3. Some pair of buds got mic problem like I'd got with my first pair, but the replacement pair worked fine so far.4. Bass is clear when u make perfect fit silicon straps. Wudve been perfect Basshead, if driver placed near to silicon caps. There is little bit of sound leakage I felt.5. Volume doesn't reach its loudness, need to use sound control apps for horror or some intensive low sound movies if you're watching.Overall a very good budget tws earbud.Thumps up for Amazon's quickest delivery even during this essentials only days! Hats off to all amazon's frontline delivery partners.The replacement also didn't take much of my time."

 Very nice product bass is also nice at this price point and vocals, treble and call quality is very nice. Everything is superb battery life also very nice sound output is also nice no disturbance and distortion. Very nice product. Sound quality also varies with ear size and ear tip size so try changing eartips from medium to other size based on your ear I changed to small then I got it fit perfectly in ear"
"I really like the product Premium, Classy and resembles airpods. Am happy with this product .Type c charging is provided which is useful. Must buy earbuds.. Awesome sound effect. Same sound quality as boat headsets. Overall performance is fabulous in this price range and I highly recommend It's is completely worth."
Honest review which no one will tell. Always hiss noise comes from the earbuds which is very irritating.Disconnection happens every now and then if you move a little away.It takes more time to charge fully than as it is mentioned.
Just received these a couple hours ago. I'm not sure if it's a defective product or not cuz the sound quality is just downright horrible. Vocals barely audible at max volume forget about bass. Tried with different phones. IOS and android. They sound the same. HORRIBLE. I've already ordered a replacement. Will update if they're any different.Edit.: received replacement today. Sound exactly the same. I'm perplexed as to how people are praising these and liking how they sound. They're exactly how fake tws sound if not worse. Wouldn't advise anyone to buy this.
Honestly I don't know what to say. I purchased it after reading positive reviews. Even after charging for 6hours it's say low better. Sound quality is average. Changing is a big issue. Waste of money. I had same issue with 1st product I received & requested for replacement. Product which I received after replacement have same issue. I wish if I could give 0 stars. It past the 8days of expected date of pickup but no one came to pick up. Such a unsatisfied customer service.
I am writing this review after 2 months ...Earphone is very cute and light box but after 2 months with occasional use hardly 10 times use the one piece is not charging at all.
I got my Boult Audio Airbass and it arrived in less time than expected the sound quality of this Bolt audio is super cool and the noise cancellation feature is also good that works very fine.the thing that I like the most about this product is that  the battery life of this product is till 24 hour that is more than enough for daily usage.and for the gamers it is Uber cool that it has a less sound latency and you can turn it on whenever you want..
The sound quality is horrible. The reception range is less than 1 metre.  It seems I got cheated on buying this. Now they should return the product and pay back.  I am Amazon pime customer and helpless after buying this.  Amazon should consider to return the product in place of replace.
"I received the product in 1 day, first experience was ok , light weight & good sound etc, but when the battery went low, it can't be charged. If it is not charging how can be used, so I ordered for replacement."

Battery backup is like never seen before on any of the TWS so far, lasted more than 9 hrs on full charge without the case.4. So light that u feel once adjusted, you won't feel itchiness, exact size silicon caps selection plays important role.5. Although case build quality is not upto the mark but fits in any of the jeans coin packet easily.6. Call quality is absolutely so great that the other party couldn't even recognize you're on a headphone unless you're on streets as there is no ANC.Cons:1. All the buds are of plastic glossy feel attract dust and fingerprints.2. The not mentioned gaming mode zero latency that most youtubers blown in their recent reviews is just a gimmick, I didn't even spot any difference between the selections.3. Some pair of buds got mic problem like I'd got with my first pair, but the replacement pair worked fine so far.4. Bass is clear when u make perfect fit silicon straps. Wudve been perfect Basshead, if driver placed near to silicon caps. There is little bit of sound leakage I felt.5. Volume doesn't reach its loudness, need to use sound control apps for horror or some intensive low sound movies if you're watching.Overall a very good budget tws earbud.Thumps up for Amazon's quickest delivery even during this essentials only days! Hats off to all amazon's frontline delivery partners.The replacement also didn't take much of my time."

 Very nice product bass is also nice at this price point and vocals, treble and call quality is very nice. Everything is superb battery life also very nice sound output is also nice no disturbance and distortion. Very nice product. Sound quality also varies with ear size and ear tip size so try changing eartips from medium to other size based on your ear I changed to small then I got it fit perfectly in ear"
"I really like the product Premium, Classy and resembles airpods. Am happy with this product .Type c charging is provided which is useful. Must buy earbuds.. Awesome sound effect. Same sound quality as boat headsets. Overall performance is fabulous in this price range and I highly recommend It's is completely worth."
Honest review which no one will tell. Always hiss noise comes from the earbuds which is very irritating.Disconnection happens every now and then if you move a little away.It takes more time to charge fully than as it is mentioned.
Just received these a couple hours ago. I'm not sure if it's a defective product or not cuz the sound quality is just downright horrible. Vocals barely audible at max volume forget about bass. Tried with different phones. IOS and android. They sound the same. HORRIBLE. I've already ordered a replacement. Will update if they're any different.Edit.: received replacement today. Sound exactly the same. I'm perplexed as to how people are praising these and liking how they sound. They're exactly how fake tws sound if not worse. Wouldn't advise anyone to buy this.
Honestly I don't know what to say. I purchased it after reading positive reviews. Even after charging for 6hours it's say low better. Sound quality is average. Changing is a big issue. Waste of money. I had same issue with 1st product I received & requested for replacement. Product which I received after replacement have same issue. I wish if I could give 0 stars. It past the 8days of expected date of pickup but no one came to pick up. Such a unsatisfied customer service.
I am writing this review after 2 months ...Earphone is very cute and light box but after 2 months with occasional use hardly 10 times use the one piece is not charging at all.
I got my Boult Audio Airbass and it arrived in less time than expected the sound quality of this Bolt audio is super cool and the noise cancellation feature is also good that works very fine.the thing that I like the most about this product is that  the battery life of this product is till 24 hour that is more than enough for daily usage.and for the gamers it is Uber cool that it has a less sound latency and you can turn it on whenever you want..
The sound quality is horrible. The reception range is less than 1 metre.  It seems I got cheated on buying this. Now they should return the product and pay back.  I am Amazon pime customer and helpless after buying this.  Amazon should consider to return the product in place of replace.
"I received the product in 1 day, first experience was ok , light weight & good sound etc, but when the battery went low, it can't be charged. If it is not charging how can be used, so I ordered for replacement."

Battery backup is like never seen before on any of the TWS so far, lasted more than 9 hrs on full charge without the case.4. So light that u feel once adjusted, you won't feel itchiness, exact size silicon caps selection plays important role.5. Although case build quality is not upto the mark but fits in any of the jeans coin packet easily.6. Call quality is absolutely so great that the other party couldn't even recognize you're on a headphone unless you're on streets as there is no ANC.Cons:1. All the buds are of plastic glossy feel attract dust and fingerprints.2. The not mentioned gaming mode zero latency that most youtubers blown in their recent reviews is just a gimmick, I didn't even spot any difference between the selections.3. Some pair of buds got mic problem like I'd got with my first pair, but the replacement pair worked fine so far.4. Bass is clear when u make perfect fit silicon straps. Wudve been perfect Basshead, if driver placed near to silicon caps. There is little bit of sound leakage I felt.5. Volume doesn't reach its loudness, need to use sound control apps for horror or some intensive low sound movies if you're watching.Overall a very good budget tws earbud.Thumps up for Amazon's quickest delivery even during this essentials only days! Hats off to all amazon's frontline delivery partners.The replacement also didn't take much of my time."

 Very nice product bass is also nice at this price point and vocals, treble and call quality is very nice. Everything is superb battery life also very nice sound output is also nice no disturbance and distortion. Very nice product. Sound quality also varies with ear size and ear tip size so try changing eartips from medium to other size based on your ear I changed to small then I got it fit perfectly in ear"
"I really like the product Premium, Classy and resembles airpods. Am happy with this product .Type c charging is provided which is useful. Must buy earbuds.. Awesome sound effect. Same sound quality as boat headsets. Overall performance is fabulous in this price range and I highly recommend It's is completely worth."
Honest review which no one will tell. Always hiss noise comes from the earbuds which is very irritating.Disconnection happens every now and then if you move a little away.It takes more time to charge fully than as it is mentioned.
Just received these a couple hours ago. I'm not sure if it's a defective product or not cuz the sound quality is just downright horrible. Vocals barely audible at max volume forget about bass. Tried with different phones. IOS and android. They sound the same. HORRIBLE. I've already ordered a replacement. Will update if they're any different.Edit.: received replacement today. Sound exactly the same. I'm perplexed as to how people are praising these and liking how they sound. They're exactly how fake tws sound if not worse. Wouldn't advise anyone to buy this.
Honestly I don't know what to say. I purchased it after reading positive reviews. Even after charging for 6hours it's say low better. Sound quality is average. Changing is a big issue. Waste of money. I had same issue with 1st product I received & requested for replacement. Product which I received after replacement have same issue. I wish if I could give 0 stars. It past the 8days of expected date of pickup but no one came to pick up. Such a unsatisfied customer service.
I am writing this review after 2 months ...Earphone is very cute and light box but after 2 months with occasional use hardly 10 times use the one piece is not charging at all.
I got my Boult Audio Airbass and it arrived in less time than expected the sound quality of this Bolt audio is super cool and the noise cancellation feature is also good that works very fine.the thing that I like the most about this product is that  the battery life of this product is till 24 hour that is more than enough for daily usage.and for the gamers it is Uber cool that it has a less sound latency and you can turn it on whenever you want..
The sound quality is horrible. The reception range is less than 1 metre.  It seems I got cheated on buying this. Now they should return the product and pay back.  I am Amazon pime customer and helpless after buying this.  Amazon should consider to return the product in place of replace.
"I received the product in 1 day, first experience was ok , light weight & good sound etc, but when the battery went low, it can't be charged. If it is not charging how can be used, so I ordered for replacement."

Battery backup is like never seen before on any of the TWS so far, lasted more than 9 hrs on full charge without the case.4. So light that u feel once adjusted, you won't feel itchiness, exact size silicon caps selection plays important role.5. Although case build quality is not upto the mark but fits in any of the jeans coin packet easily.6. Call quality is absolutely so great that the other party couldn't even recognize you're on a headphone unless you're on streets as there is no ANC.Cons:1. All the buds are of plastic glossy feel attract dust and fingerprints.2. The not mentioned gaming mode zero latency that most youtubers blown in their recent reviews is just a gimmick, I didn't even spot any difference between the selections.3. Some pair of buds got mic problem like I'd got with my first pair, but the replacement pair worked fine so far.4. Bass is clear when u make perfect fit silicon straps. Wudve been perfect Basshead, if driver placed near to silicon caps. There is little bit of sound leakage I felt.5. Volume doesn't reach its loudness, need to use sound control apps for horror or some intensive low sound movies if you're watching.Overall a very good budget tws earbud.Thumps up for Amazon's quickest delivery even during this essentials only days! Hats off to all amazon's frontline delivery partners.The replacement also didn't take much of my time."

 Very nice product bass is also nice at this price point and vocals, treble and call quality is very nice. Everything is superb battery life also very nice sound output is also nice no disturbance and distortion. Very nice product. Sound quality also varies with ear size and ear tip size so try changing eartips from medium to other size based on your ear I changed to small then I got it fit perfectly in ear"
"I really like the product Premium, Classy and resembles airpods. Am happy with this product .Type c charging is provided which is useful. Must buy earbuds.. Awesome sound effect. Same sound quality as boat headsets. Overall performance is fabulous in this price range and I highly recommend It's is completely worth."
Honest review which no one will tell. Always hiss noise comes from the earbuds which is very irritating.Disconnection happens every now and then if you move a little away.It takes more time to charge fully than as it is mentioned.
Just received these a couple hours ago. I'm not sure if it's a defective product or not cuz the sound quality is just downright horrible. Vocals barely audible at max volume forget about bass. Tried with different phones. IOS and android. They sound the same. HORRIBLE. I've already ordered a replacement. Will update if they're any different.Edit.: received replacement today. Sound exactly the same. I'm perplexed as to how people are praising these and liking how they sound. They're exactly how fake tws sound if not worse. Wouldn't advise anyone to buy this.
Honestly I don't know what to say. I purchased it after reading positive reviews. Even after charging for 6hours it's say low better. Sound quality is average. Changing is a big issue. Waste of money. I had same issue with 1st product I received & requested for replacement. Product which I received after replacement have same issue. I wish if I could give 0 stars. It past the 8days of expected date of pickup but no one came to pick up. Such a unsatisfied customer service.
I am writing this review after 2 months ...Earphone is very cute and light box but after 2 months with occasional use hardly 10 times use the one piece is not charging at all.
I got my Boult Audio Airbass and it arrived in less time than expected the sound quality of this Bolt audio is super cool and the noise cancellation feature is also good that works very fine.the thing that I like the most about this product is that  the battery life of this product is till 24 hour that is more than enough for daily usage.and for the gamers it is Uber cool that it has a less sound latency and you can turn it on whenever you want..
The sound quality is horrible. The reception range is less than 1 metre.  It seems I got cheated on buying this. Now they should return the product and pay back.  I am Amazon pime customer and helpless after buying this.  Amazon should consider to return the product in place of replace.
"I received the product in 1 day, first experience was ok , light weight & good sound etc, but when the battery went low, it can't be charged. If it is not charging how can be used, so I ordered for replacement."

Battery backup is like never seen before on any of the TWS so far, lasted more than 9 hrs on full charge without the case.4. So light that u feel once adjusted, you won't feel itchiness, exact size silicon caps selection plays important role.5. Although case build quality is not upto the mark but fits in any of the jeans coin packet easily.6. Call quality is absolutely so great that the other party couldn't even recognize you're on a headphone unless you're on streets as there is no ANC.Cons:1. All the buds are of plastic glossy feel attract dust and fingerprints.2. The not mentioned gaming mode zero latency that most youtubers blown in their recent reviews is just a gimmick, I didn't even spot any difference between the selections.3. Some pair of buds got mic problem like I'd got with my first pair, but the replacement pair worked fine so far.4. Bass is clear when u make perfect fit silicon straps. Wudve been perfect Basshead, if driver placed near to silicon caps. There is little bit of sound leakage I felt.5. Volume doesn't reach its loudness, need to use sound control apps for horror or some intensive low sound movies if you're watching.Overall a very good budget tws earbud.Thumps up for Amazon's quickest delivery even during this essentials only days! Hats off to all amazon's frontline delivery partners.The replacement also didn't take much of my time."

 Very nice product bass is also nice at this price point and vocals, treble and call quality is very nice. Everything is superb battery life also very nice sound output is also nice no disturbance and distortion. Very nice product. Sound quality also varies with ear size and ear tip size so try changing eartips from medium to other size based on your ear I changed to small then I got it fit perfectly in ear"
"I really like the product Premium, Classy and resembles airpods. Am happy with this product .Type c charging is provided which is useful. Must buy earbuds.. Awesome sound effect. Same sound quality as boat headsets. Overall performance is fabulous in this price range and I highly recommend It's is completely worth."
Honest review which no one will tell. Always hiss noise comes from the earbuds which is very irritating.Disconnection happens every now and then if you move a little away.It takes more time to charge fully than as it is mentioned.
Just received these a couple hours ago. I'm not sure if it's a defective product or not cuz the sound quality is just downright horrible. Vocals barely audible at max volume forget about bass. Tried with different phones. IOS and android. They sound the same. HORRIBLE. I've already ordered a replacement. Will update if they're any different.Edit.: received replacement today. Sound exactly the same. I'm perplexed as to how people are praising these and liking how they sound. They're exactly how fake tws sound if not worse. Wouldn't advise anyone to buy this.
Honestly I don't know what to say. I purchased it after reading positive reviews. Even after charging for 6hours it's say low better. Sound quality is average. Changing is a big issue. Waste of money. I had same issue with 1st product I received & requested for replacement. Product which I received after replacement have same issue. I wish if I could give 0 stars. It past the 8days of expected date of pickup but no one came to pick up. Such a unsatisfied customer service.
I am writing this review after 2 months ...Earphone is very cute and light box but after 2 months with occasional use hardly 10 times use the one piece is not charging at all.
I got my Boult Audio Airbass and it arrived in less time than expected the sound quality of this Bolt audio is super cool and the noise cancellation feature is also good that works very fine.the thing that I like the most about this product is that  the battery life of this product is till 24 hour that is more than enough for daily usage.and for the gamers it is Uber cool that it has a less sound latency and you can turn it on whenever you want..
The sound quality is horrible. The reception range is less than 1 metre.  It seems I got cheated on buying this. Now they should return the product and pay back.  I am Amazon pime customer and helpless after buying this.  Amazon should consider to return the product in place of replace.
"I received the product in 1 day, first experience was ok , light weight & good sound etc, but when the battery went low, it can't be charged. If it is not charging how can be used, so I ordered for replacement."

Battery backup is like never seen before on any of the TWS so far, lasted more than 9 hrs on full charge without the case.4. So light that u feel once adjusted, you won't feel itchiness, exact size silicon caps selection plays important role.5. Although case build quality is not upto the mark but fits in any of the jeans coin packet easily.6. Call quality is absolutely so great that the other party couldn't even recognize you're on a headphone unless you're on streets as there is no ANC.Cons:1. All the buds are of plastic glossy feel attract dust and fingerprints.2. The not mentioned gaming mode zero latency that most youtubers blown in their recent reviews is just a gimmick, I didn't even spot any difference between the selections.3. Some pair of buds got mic problem like I'd got with my first pair, but the replacement pair worked fine so far.4. Bass is clear when u make perfect fit silicon straps. Wudve been perfect Basshead, if driver placed near to silicon caps. There is little bit of sound leakage I felt.5. Volume doesn't reach its loudness, need to use sound control apps for horror or some intensive low sound movies if you're watching.Overall a very good budget tws earbud.Thumps up for Amazon's quickest delivery even during this essentials only days! Hats off to all amazon's frontline delivery partners.The replacement also didn't take much of my time."

 Very nice product bass is also nice at this price point and vocals, treble and call quality is very nice. Everything is superb battery life also very nice sound output is also nice no disturbance and distortion. Very nice product. Sound quality also varies with ear size and ear tip size so try changing eartips from medium to other size based on your ear I changed to small then I got it fit perfectly in ear"
"I really like the product Premium, Classy and resembles airpods. Am happy with this product .Type c charging is provided which is useful. Must buy earbuds.. Awesome sound effect. Same sound quality as boat headsets. Overall performance is fabulous in this price range and I highly recommend It's is completely worth."
Honest review which no one will tell. Always hiss noise comes from the earbuds which is very irritating.Disconnection happens every now and then if you move a little away.It takes more time to charge fully than as it is mentioned.
Just received these a couple hours ago. I'm not sure if it's a defective product or not cuz the sound quality is just downright horrible. Vocals barely audible at max volume forget about bass. Tried with different phones. IOS and android. They sound the same. HORRIBLE. I've already ordered a replacement. Will update if they're any different.Edit.: received replacement today. Sound exactly the same. I'm perplexed as to how people are praising these and liking how they sound. They're exactly how fake tws sound if not worse. Wouldn't advise anyone to buy this.
Honestly I don't know what to say. I purchased it after reading positive reviews. Even after charging for 6hours it's say low better. Sound quality is average. Changing is a big issue. Waste of money. I had same issue with 1st product I received & requested for replacement. Product which I received after replacement have same issue. I wish if I could give 0 stars. It past the 8days of expected date of pickup but no one came to pick up. Such a unsatisfied customer service.
I am writing this review after 2 months ...Earphone is very cute and light box but after 2 months with occasional use hardly 10 times use the one piece is not charging at all.
I got my Boult Audio Airbass and it arrived in less time than expected the sound quality of this Bolt audio is super cool and the noise cancellation feature is also good that works very fine.the thing that I like the most about this product is that  the battery life of this product is till 24 hour that is more than enough for daily usage.and for the gamers it is Uber cool that it has a less sound latency and you can turn it on whenever you want..
The sound quality is horrible. The reception range is less than 1 metre.  It seems I got cheated on buying this. Now they should return the product and pay back.  I am Amazon pime customer and helpless after buying this.  Amazon should consider to return the product in place of replace.
"I received the product in 1 day, first experience was ok , light weight & good sound etc, but when the battery went low, it can't be charged. If it is not charging how can be used, so I ordered for replacement."

Battery backup is like never seen before on any of the TWS so far, lasted more than 9 hrs on full charge without the case.4. So light that u feel once adjusted, you won't feel itchiness, exact size silicon caps selection plays important role.5. Although case build quality is not upto the mark but fits in any of the jeans coin packet easily.6. Call quality is absolutely so great that the other party couldn't even recognize you're on a headphone unless you're on streets as there is no ANC.Cons:1. All the buds are of plastic glossy feel attract dust and fingerprints.2. The not mentioned gaming mode zero latency that most youtubers blown in their recent reviews is just a gimmick, I didn't even spot any difference between the selections.3. Some pair of buds got mic problem like I'd got with my first pair, but the replacement pair worked fine so far.4. Bass is clear when u make perfect fit silicon straps. Wudve been perfect Basshead, if driver placed near to silicon caps. There is little bit of sound leakage I felt.5. Volume doesn't reach its loudness, need to use sound control apps for horror or some intensive low sound movies if you're watching.Overall a very good budget tws earbud.Thumps up for Amazon's quickest delivery even during this essentials only days! Hats off to all amazon's frontline delivery partners.The replacement also didn't take much of my time."

 Very nice product bass is also nice at this price point and vocals, treble and call quality is very nice. Everything is superb battery life also very nice sound output is also nice no disturbance and distortion. Very nice product. Sound quality also varies with ear size and ear tip size so try changing eartips from medium to other size based on your ear I changed to small then I got it fit perfectly in ear"
"I really like the product Premium, Classy and resembles airpods. Am happy with this product .Type c charging is provided which is useful. Must buy earbuds.. Awesome sound effect. Same sound quality as boat headsets. Overall performance is fabulous in this price range and I highly recommend It's is completely worth."
Honest review which no one will tell. Always hiss noise comes from the earbuds which is very irritating.Disconnection happens every now and then if you move a little away.It takes more time to charge fully than as it is mentioned.
Just received these a couple hours ago. I'm not sure if it's a defective product or not cuz the sound quality is just downright horrible. Vocals barely audible at max volume forget about bass. Tried with different phones. IOS and android. They sound the same. HORRIBLE. I've already ordered a replacement. Will update if they're any different.Edit.: received replacement today. Sound exactly the same. I'm perplexed as to how people are praising these and liking how they sound. They're exactly how fake tws sound if not worse. Wouldn't advise anyone to buy this.
Honestly I don't know what to say. I purchased it after reading positive reviews. Even after charging for 6hours it's say low better. Sound quality is average. Changing is a big issue. Waste of money. I had same issue with 1st product I received & requested for replacement. Product which I received after replacement have same issue. I wish if I could give 0 stars. It past the 8days of expected date of pickup but no one came to pick up. Such a unsatisfied customer service.
I am writing this review after 2 months ...Earphone is very cute and light box but after 2 months with occasional use hardly 10 times use the one piece is not charging at all.
I got my Boult Audio Airbass and it arrived in less time than expected the sound quality of this Bolt audio is super cool and the noise cancellation feature is also good that works very fine.the thing that I like the most about this product is that  the battery life of this product is till 24 hour that is more than enough for daily usage.and for the gamers it is Uber cool that it has a less sound latency and you can turn it on whenever you want..
The sound quality is horrible. The reception range is less than 1 metre.  It seems I got cheated on buying this. Now they should return the product and pay back.  I am Amazon pime customer and helpless after buying this.  Amazon should consider to return the product in place of replace.
"I received the product in 1 day, first experience was ok , light weight & good sound etc, but when the battery went low, it can't be charged. If it is not charging how can be used, so I ordered for replacement."

Battery backup is like never seen before on any of the TWS so far, lasted more than 9 hrs on full charge without the case.4. So light that u feel once adjusted, you won't feel itchiness, exact size silicon caps selection plays important role.5. Although case build quality is not upto the mark but fits in any of the jeans coin packet easily.6. Call quality is absolutely so great that the other party couldn't even recognize you're on a headphone unless you're on streets as there is no ANC.Cons:1. All the buds are of plastic glossy feel attract dust and fingerprints.2. The not mentioned gaming mode zero latency that most youtubers blown in their recent reviews is just a gimmick, I didn't even spot any difference between the selections.3. Some pair of buds got mic problem like I'd got with my first pair, but the replacement pair worked fine so far.4. Bass is clear when u make perfect fit silicon straps. Wudve been perfect Basshead, if driver placed near to silicon caps. There is little bit of sound leakage I felt.5. Volume doesn't reach its loudness, need to use sound control apps for horror or some intensive low sound movies if you're watching.Overall a very good budget tws earbud.Thumps up for Amazon's quickest delivery even during this essentials only days! Hats off to all amazon's frontline delivery partners.The replacement also didn't take much of my time."

 Very nice product bass is also nice at this price point and vocals, treble and call quality is very nice. Everything is superb battery life also very nice sound output is also nice no disturbance and distortion. Very nice product. Sound quality also varies with ear size and ear tip size so try changing eartips from medium to other size based on your ear I changed to small then I got it fit perfectly in ear"
"I really like the product Premium, Classy and resembles airpods. Am happy with this product .Type c charging is provided which is useful. Must buy earbuds.. Awesome sound effect. Same sound quality as boat headsets. Overall performance is fabulous in this price range and I highly recommend It's is completely worth."
Honest review which no one will tell. Always hiss noise comes from the earbuds which is very irritating.Disconnection happens every now and then if you move a little away.It takes more time to charge fully than as it is mentioned.
Just received these a couple hours ago. I'm not sure if it's a defective product or not cuz the sound quality is just downright horrible. Vocals barely audible at max volume forget about bass. Tried with different phones. IOS and android. They sound the same. HORRIBLE. I've already ordered a replacement. Will update if they're any different.Edit.: received replacement today. Sound exactly the same. I'm perplexed as to how people are praising these and liking how they sound. They're exactly how fake tws sound if not worse. Wouldn't advise anyone to buy this.
Honestly I don't know what to say. I purchased it after reading positive reviews. Even after charging for 6hours it's say low better. Sound quality is average. Changing is a big issue. Waste of money. I had same issue with 1st product I received & requested for replacement. Product which I received after replacement have same issue. I wish if I could give 0 stars. It past the 8days of expected date of pickup but no one came to pick up. Such a unsatisfied customer service.
I am writing this review after 2 months ...Earphone is very cute and light box but after 2 months with occasional use hardly 10 times use the one piece is not charging at all.
I got my Boult Audio Airbass and it arrived in less time than expected the sound quality of this Bolt audio is super cool and the noise cancellation feature is also good that works very fine.the thing that I like the most about this product is that  the battery life of this product is till 24 hour that is more than enough for daily usage.and for the gamers it is Uber cool that it has a less sound latency and you can turn it on whenever you want..
The sound quality is horrible. The reception range is less than 1 metre.  It seems I got cheated on buying this. Now they should return the product and pay back.  I am Amazon pime customer and helpless after buying this.  Amazon should consider to return the product in place of replace.
"I received the product in 1 day, first experience was ok , light weight & good sound etc, but when the battery went low, it can't be charged. If it is not charging how can be used, so I ordered for replacement."

Battery backup is like never seen before on any of the TWS so far, lasted more than 9 hrs on full charge without the case.4. So light that u feel once adjusted, you won't feel itchiness, exact size silicon caps selection plays important role.5. Although case build quality is not upto the mark but fits in any of the jeans coin packet easily.6. Call quality is absolutely so great that the other party couldn't even recognize you're on a headphone unless you're on streets as there is no ANC.Cons:1. All the buds are of plastic glossy feel attract dust and fingerprints.2. The not mentioned gaming mode zero latency that most youtubers blown in their recent reviews is just a gimmick, I didn't even spot any difference between the selections.3. Some pair of buds got mic problem like I'd got with my first pair, but the replacement pair worked fine so far.4. Bass is clear when u make perfect fit silicon straps. Wudve been perfect Basshead, if driver placed near to silicon caps. There is little bit of sound leakage I felt.5. Volume doesn't reach its loudness, need to use sound control apps for horror or some intensive low sound movies if you're watching.Overall a very good budget tws earbud.Thumps up for Amazon's quickest delivery even during this essentials only days! Hats off to all amazon's frontline delivery partners.The replacement also didn't take much of my time."

 Very nice product bass is also nice at this price point and vocals, treble and call quality is very nice. Everything is superb battery life also very nice sound output is also nice no disturbance and distortion. Very nice product. Sound quality also varies with ear size and ear tip size so try changing eartips from medium to other size based on your ear I changed to small then I got it fit perfectly in ear"
"I really like the product Premium, Classy and resembles airpods. Am happy with this product .Type c charging is provided which is useful. Must buy earbuds.. Awesome sound effect. Same sound quality as boat headsets. Overall performance is fabulous in this price range and I highly recommend It's is completely worth."
Honest review which no one will tell. Always hiss noise comes from the earbuds which is very irritating.Disconnection happens every now and then if you move a little away.It takes more time to charge fully than as it is mentioned.
Just received these a couple hours ago. I'm not sure if it's a defective product or not cuz the sound quality is just downright horrible. Vocals barely audible at max volume forget about bass. Tried with different phones. IOS and android. They sound the same. HORRIBLE. I've already ordered a replacement. Will update if they're any different.Edit.: received replacement today. Sound exactly the same. I'm perplexed as to how people are praising these and liking how they sound. They're exactly how fake tws sound if not worse. Wouldn't advise anyone to buy this.
Honestly I don't know what to say. I purchased it after reading positive reviews. Even after charging for 6hours it's say low better. Sound quality is average. Changing is a big issue. Waste of money. I had same issue with 1st product I received & requested for replacement. Product which I received after replacement have same issue. I wish if I could give 0 stars. It past the 8days of expected date of pickup but no one came to pick up. Such a unsatisfied customer service.
I am writing this review after 2 months ...Earphone is very cute and light box but after 2 months with occasional use hardly 10 times use the one piece is not charging at all.
I got my Boult Audio Airbass and it arrived in less time than expected the sound quality of this Bolt audio is super cool and the noise cancellation feature is also good that works very fine.the thing that I like the most about this product is that  the battery life of this product is till 24 hour that is more than enough for daily usage.and for the gamers it is Uber cool that it has a less sound latency and you can turn it on whenever you want..
The sound quality is horrible. The reception range is less than 1 metre.  It seems I got cheated on buying this. Now they should return the product and pay back.  I am Amazon pime customer and helpless after buying this.  Amazon should consider to return the product in place of replace.
"I received the product in 1 day, first experience was ok , light weight & good sound etc, but when the battery went low, it can't be charged. If it is not charging how can be used, so I ordered for replacement."

Battery backup is like never seen before on any of the TWS so far, lasted more than 9 hrs on full charge without the case.4. So light that u feel once adjusted, you won't feel itchiness, exact size silicon caps selection plays important role.5. Although case build quality is not upto the mark but fits in any of the jeans coin packet easily.6. Call quality is absolutely so great that the other party couldn't even recognize you're on a headphone unless you're on streets as there is no ANC.Cons:1. All the buds are of plastic glossy feel attract dust and fingerprints.2. The not mentioned gaming mode zero latency that most youtubers blown in their recent reviews is just a gimmick, I didn't even spot any difference between the selections.3. Some pair of buds got mic problem like I'd got with my first pair, but the replacement pair worked fine so far.4. Bass is clear when u make perfect fit silicon straps. Wudve been perfect Basshead, if driver placed near to silicon caps. There is little bit of sound leakage I felt.5. Volume doesn't reach its loudness, need to use sound control apps for horror or some intensive low sound movies if you're watching.Overall a very good budget tws earbud.Thumps up for Amazon's quickest delivery even during this essentials only days! Hats off to all amazon's frontline delivery partners.The replacement also didn't take much of my time."

 Very nice product bass is also nice at this price point and vocals, treble and call quality is very nice. Everything is superb battery life also very nice sound output is also nice no disturbance and distortion. Very nice product. Sound quality also varies with ear size and ear tip size so try changing eartips from medium to other size based on your ear I changed to small then I got it fit perfectly in ear"
"I really like the product Premium, Classy and resembles airpods. Am happy with this product .Type c charging is provided which is useful. Must buy earbuds.. Awesome sound effect. Same sound quality as boat headsets. Overall performance is fabulous in this price range and I highly recommend It's is completely worth."
Honest review which no one will tell. Always hiss noise comes from the earbuds which is very irritating.Disconnection happens every now and then if you move a little away.It takes more time to charge fully than as it is mentioned.
Just received these a couple hours ago. I'm not sure if it's a defective product or not cuz the sound quality is just downright horrible. Vocals barely audible at max volume forget about bass. Tried with different phones. IOS and android. They sound the same. HORRIBLE. I've already ordered a replacement. Will update if they're any different.Edit.: received replacement today. Sound exactly the same. I'm perplexed as to how people are praising these and liking how they sound. They're exactly how fake tws sound if not worse. Wouldn't advise anyone to buy this.
Honestly I don't know what to say. I purchased it after reading positive reviews. Even after charging for 6hours it's say low better. Sound quality is average. Changing is a big issue. Waste of money. I had same issue with 1st product I received & requested for replacement. Product which I received after replacement have same issue. I wish if I could give 0 stars. It past the 8days of expected date of pickup but no one came to pick up. Such a unsatisfied customer service.
I am writing this review after 2 months ...Earphone is very cute and light box but after 2 months with occasional use hardly 10 times use the one piece is not charging at all.
I got my Boult Audio Airbass and it arrived in less time than expected the sound quality of this Bolt audio is super cool and the noise cancellation feature is also good that works very fine.the thing that I like the most about this product is that  the battery life of this product is till 24 hour that is more than enough for daily usage.and for the gamers it is Uber cool that it has a less sound latency and you can turn it on whenever you want..
The sound quality is horrible. The reception range is less than 1 metre.  It seems I got cheated on buying this. Now they should return the product and pay back.  I am Amazon pime customer and helpless after buying this.  Amazon should consider to return the product in place of replace.
"I received the product in 1 day, first experience was ok , light weight & good sound etc, but when the battery went low, it can't be charged. If it is not charging how can be used, so I ordered for replacement."

Battery backup is like never seen before on any of the TWS so far, lasted more than 9 hrs on full charge without the case.4. So light that u feel once adjusted, you won't feel itchiness, exact size silicon caps selection plays important role.5. Although case build quality is not upto the mark but fits in any of the jeans coin packet easily.6. Call quality is absolutely so great that the other party couldn't even recognize you're on a headphone unless you're on streets as there is no ANC.Cons:1. All the buds are of plastic glossy feel attract dust and fingerprints.2. The not mentioned gaming mode zero latency that most youtubers blown in their recent reviews is just a gimmick, I didn't even spot any difference between the selections.3. Some pair of buds got mic problem like I'd got with my first pair, but the replacement pair worked fine so far.4. Bass is clear when u make perfect fit silicon straps. Wudve been perfect Basshead, if driver placed near to silicon caps. There is little bit of sound leakage I felt.5. Volume doesn't reach its loudness, need to use sound control apps for horror or some intensive low sound movies if you're watching.Overall a very good budget tws earbud.Thumps up for Amazon's quickest delivery even during this essentials only days! Hats off to all amazon's frontline delivery partners.The replacement also didn't take much of my time."

 Very nice product bass is also nice at this price point and vocals, treble and call quality is very nice. Everything is superb battery life also very nice sound output is also nice no disturbance and distortion. Very nice product. Sound quality also varies with ear size and ear tip size so try changing eartips from medium to other size based on your ear I changed to small then I got it fit perfectly in ear"
"I really like the product Premium, Classy and resembles airpods. Am happy with this product .Type c charging is provided which is useful. Must buy earbuds.. Awesome sound effect. Same sound quality as boat headsets. Overall performance is fabulous in this price range and I highly recommend It's is completely worth."
Honest review which no one will tell. Always hiss noise comes from the earbuds which is very irritating.Disconnection happens every now and then if you move a little away.It takes more time to charge fully than as it is mentioned.
Just received these a couple hours ago. I'm not sure if it's a defective product or not cuz the sound quality is just downright horrible. Vocals barely audible at max volume forget about bass. Tried with different phones. IOS and android. They sound the same. HORRIBLE. I've already ordered a replacement. Will update if they're any different.Edit.: received replacement today. Sound exactly the same. I'm perplexed as to how people are praising these and liking how they sound. They're exactly how fake tws sound if not worse. Wouldn't advise anyone to buy this.
Honestly I don't know what to say. I purchased it after reading positive reviews. Even after charging for 6hours it's say low better. Sound quality is average. Changing is a big issue. Waste of money. I had same issue with 1st product I received & requested for replacement. Product which I received after replacement have same issue. I wish if I could give 0 stars. It past the 8days of expected date of pickup but no one came to pick up. Such a unsatisfied customer service.
I am writing this review after 2 months ...Earphone is very cute and light box but after 2 months with occasional use hardly 10 times use the one piece is not charging at all.
I got my Boult Audio Airbass and it arrived in less time than expected the sound quality of this Bolt audio is super cool and the noise cancellation feature is also good that works very fine.the thing that I like the most about this product is that  the battery life of this product is till 24 hour that is more than enough for daily usage.and for the gamers it is Uber cool that it has a less sound latency and you can turn it on whenever you want..
The sound quality is horrible. The reception range is less than 1 metre.  It seems I got cheated on buying this. Now they should return the product and pay back.  I am Amazon pime customer and helpless after buying this.  Amazon should consider to return the product in place of replace.
"I received the product in 1 day, first experience was ok , light weight & good sound etc, but when the battery went low, it can't be charged. If it is not charging how can be used, so I ordered for replacement."

Battery backup is like never seen before on any of the TWS so far, lasted more than 9 hrs on full charge without the case.4. So light that u feel once adjusted, you won't feel itchiness, exact size silicon caps selection plays important role.5. Although case build quality is not upto the mark but fits in any of the jeans coin packet easily.6. Call quality is absolutely so great that the other party couldn't even recognize you're on a headphone unless you're on streets as there is no ANC.Cons:1. All the buds are of plastic glossy feel attract dust and fingerprints.2. The not mentioned gaming mode zero latency that most youtubers blown in their recent reviews is just a gimmick, I didn't even spot any difference between the selections.3. Some pair of buds got mic problem like I'd got with my first pair, but the replacement pair worked fine so far.4. Bass is clear when u make perfect fit silicon straps. Wudve been perfect Basshead, if driver placed near to silicon caps. There is little bit of sound leakage I felt.5. Volume doesn't reach its loudness, need to use sound control apps for horror or some intensive low sound movies if you're watching.Overall a very good budget tws earbud.Thumps up for Amazon's quickest delivery even during this essentials only days! Hats off to all amazon's frontline delivery partners.The replacement also didn't take much of my time."

 Very nice product bass is also nice at this price point and vocals, treble and call quality is very nice. Everything is superb battery life also very nice sound output is also nice no disturbance and distortion. Very nice product. Sound quality also varies with ear size and ear tip size so try changing eartips from medium to other size based on your ear I changed to small then I got it fit perfectly in ear"
"I really like the product Premium, Classy and resembles airpods. Am happy with this product .Type c charging is provided which is useful. Must buy earbuds.. Awesome sound effect. Same sound quality as boat headsets. Overall performance is fabulous in this price range and I highly recommend It's is completely worth."
Honest review which no one will tell. Always hiss noise comes from the earbuds which is very irritating.Disconnection happens every now and then if you move a little away.It takes more time to charge fully than as it is mentioned.
Just received these a couple hours ago. I'm not sure if it's a defective product or not cuz the sound quality is just downright horrible. Vocals barely audible at max volume forget about bass. Tried with different phones. IOS and android. They sound the same. HORRIBLE. I've already ordered a replacement. Will update if they're any different.Edit.: received replacement today. Sound exactly the same. I'm perplexed as to how people are praising these and liking how they sound. They're exactly how fake tws sound if not worse. Wouldn't advise anyone to buy this.
Honestly I don't know what to say. I purchased it after reading positive reviews. Even after charging for 6hours it's say low better. Sound quality is average. Changing is a big issue. Waste of money. I had same issue with 1st product I received & requested for replacement. Product which I received after replacement have same issue. I wish if I could give 0 stars. It past the 8days of expected date of pickup but no one came to pick up. Such a unsatisfied customer service.
I am writing this review after 2 months ...Earphone is very cute and light box but after 2 months with occasional use hardly 10 times use the one piece is not charging at all.
I got my Boult Audio Airbass and it arrived in less time than expected the sound quality of this Bolt audio is super cool and the noise cancellation feature is also good that works very fine.the thing that I like the most about this product is that  the battery life of this product is till 24 hour that is more than enough for daily usage.and for the gamers it is Uber cool that it has a less sound latency and you can turn it on whenever you want..
The sound quality is horrible. The reception range is less than 1 metre.  It seems I got cheated on buying this. Now they should return the product and pay back.  I am Amazon pime customer and helpless after buying this.  Amazon should consider to return the product in place of replace.
"I received the product in 1 day, first experience was ok , light weight & good sound etc, but when the battery went low, it can't be charged. If it is not charging how can be used, so I ordered for replacement."

Battery backup is like never seen before on any of the TWS so far, lasted more than 9 hrs on full charge without the case.4. So light that u feel once adjusted, you won't feel itchiness, exact size silicon caps selection plays important role.5. Although case build quality is not upto the mark but fits in any of the jeans coin packet easily.6. Call quality is absolutely so great that the other party couldn't even recognize you're on a headphone unless you're on streets as there is no ANC.Cons:1. All the buds are of plastic glossy feel attract dust and fingerprints.2. The not mentioned gaming mode zero latency that most youtubers blown in their recent reviews is just a gimmick, I didn't even spot any difference between the selections.3. Some pair of buds got mic problem like I'd got with my first pair, but the replacement pair worked fine so far.4. Bass is clear when u make perfect fit silicon straps. Wudve been perfect Basshead, if driver placed near to silicon caps. There is little bit of sound leakage I felt.5. Volume doesn't reach its loudness, need to use sound control apps for horror or some intensive low sound movies if you're watching.Overall a very good budget tws earbud.Thumps up for Amazon's quickest delivery even during this essentials only days! Hats off to all amazon's frontline delivery partners.The replacement also didn't take much of my time."

 Very nice product bass is also nice at this price point and vocals, treble and call quality is very nice. Everything is superb battery life also very nice sound output is also nice no disturbance and distortion. Very nice product. Sound quality also varies with ear size and ear tip size so try changing eartips from medium to other size based on your ear I changed to small then I got it fit perfectly in ear"
"I really like the product Premium, Classy and resembles airpods. Am happy with this product .Type c charging is provided which is useful. Must buy earbuds.. Awesome sound effect. Same sound quality as boat headsets. Overall performance is fabulous in this price range and I highly recommend It's is completely worth."
Honest review which no one will tell. Always hiss noise comes from the earbuds which is very irritating.Disconnection happens every now and then if you move a little away.It takes more time to charge fully than as it is mentioned.
Just received these a couple hours ago. I'm not sure if it's a defective product or not cuz the sound quality is just downright horrible. Vocals barely audible at max volume forget about bass. Tried with different phones. IOS and android. They sound the same. HORRIBLE. I've already ordered a replacement. Will update if they're any different.Edit.: received replacement today. Sound exactly the same. I'm perplexed as to how people are praising these and liking how they sound. They're exactly how fake tws sound if not worse. Wouldn't advise anyone to buy this.
Honestly I don't know what to say. I purchased it after reading positive reviews. Even after charging for 6hours it's say low better. Sound quality is average. Changing is a big issue. Waste of money. I had same issue with 1st product I received & requested for replacement. Product which I received after replacement have same issue. I wish if I could give 0 stars. It past the 8days of expected date of pickup but no one came to pick up. Such a unsatisfied customer service.
I am writing this review after 2 months ...Earphone is very cute and light box but after 2 months with occasional use hardly 10 times use the one piece is not charging at all.
I got my Boult Audio Airbass and it arrived in less time than expected the sound quality of this Bolt audio is super cool and the noise cancellation feature is also good that works very fine.the thing that I like the most about this product is that  the battery life of this product is till 24 hour that is more than enough for daily usage.and for the gamers it is Uber cool that it has a less sound latency and you can turn it on whenever you want..
The sound quality is horrible. The reception range is less than 1 metre.  It seems I got cheated on buying this. Now they should return the product and pay back.  I am Amazon pime customer and helpless after buying this.  Amazon should consider to return the product in place of replace.
"I received the product in 1 day, first experience was ok , light weight & good sound etc, but when the battery went low, it can't be charged. If it is not charging how can be used, so I ordered for replacement."

Battery backup is like never seen before on any of the TWS so far, lasted more than 9 hrs on full charge without the case.4. So light that u feel once adjusted, you won't feel itchiness, exact size silicon caps selection plays important role.5. Although case build quality is not upto the mark but fits in any of the jeans coin packet easily.6. Call quality is absolutely so great that the other party couldn't even recognize you're on a headphone unless you're on streets as there is no ANC.Cons:1. All the buds are of plastic glossy feel attract dust and fingerprints.2. The not mentioned gaming mode zero latency that most youtubers blown in their recent reviews is just a gimmick, I didn't even spot any difference between the selections.3. Some pair of buds got mic problem like I'd got with my first pair, but the replacement pair worked fine so far.4. Bass is clear when u make perfect fit silicon straps. Wudve been perfect Basshead, if driver placed near to silicon caps. There is little bit of sound leakage I felt.5. Volume doesn't reach its loudness, need to use sound control apps for horror or some intensive low sound movies if you're watching.Overall a very good budget tws earbud.Thumps up for Amazon's quickest delivery even during this essentials only days! Hats off to all amazon's frontline delivery partners.The replacement also didn't take much of my time."

 Very nice product bass is also nice at this price point and vocals, treble and call quality is very nice. Everything is superb battery life also very nice sound output is also nice no disturbance and distortion. Very nice product. Sound quality also varies with ear size and ear tip size so try changing eartips from medium to other size based on your ear I changed to small then I got it fit perfectly in ear"
"I really like the product Premium, Classy and resembles airpods. Am happy with this product .Type c charging is provided which is useful. Must buy earbuds.. Awesome sound effect. Same sound quality as boat headsets. Overall performance is fabulous in this price range and I highly recommend It's is completely worth."
Honest review which no one will tell. Always hiss noise comes from the earbuds which is very irritating.Disconnection happens every now and then if you move a little away.It takes more time to charge fully than as it is mentioned.
Just received these a couple hours ago. I'm not sure if it's a defective product or not cuz the sound quality is just downright horrible. Vocals barely audible at max volume forget about bass. Tried with different phones. IOS and android. They sound the same. HORRIBLE. I've already ordered a replacement. Will update if they're any different.Edit.: received replacement today. Sound exactly the same. I'm perplexed as to how people are praising these and liking how they sound. They're exactly how fake tws sound if not worse. Wouldn't advise anyone to buy this.
Honestly I don't know what to say. I purchased it after reading positive reviews. Even after charging for 6hours it's say low better. Sound quality is average. Changing is a big issue. Waste of money. I had same issue with 1st product I received & requested for replacement. Product which I received after replacement have same issue. I wish if I could give 0 stars. It past the 8days of expected date of pickup but no one came to pick up. Such a unsatisfied customer service.
I am writing this review after 2 months ...Earphone is very cute and light box but after 2 months with occasional use hardly 10 times use the one piece is not charging at all.
I got my Boult Audio Airbass and it arrived in less time than expected the sound quality of this Bolt audio is super cool and the noise cancellation feature is also good that works very fine.the thing that I like the most about this product is that  the battery life of this product is till 24 hour that is more than enough for daily usage.and for the gamers it is Uber cool that it has a less sound latency and you can turn it on whenever you want..
The sound quality is horrible. The reception range is less than 1 metre.  It seems I got cheated on buying this. Now they should return the product and pay back.  I am Amazon pime customer and helpless after buying this.  Amazon should consider to return the product in place of replace.
"I received the product in 1 day, first experience was ok , light weight & good sound etc, but when the battery went low, it can't be charged. If it is not charging how can be used, so I ordered for replacement."

Battery backup is like never seen before on any of the TWS so far, lasted more than 9 hrs on full charge without the case.4. So light that u feel once adjusted, you won't feel itchiness, exact size silicon caps selection plays important role.5. Although case build quality is not upto the mark but fits in any of the jeans coin packet easily.6. Call quality is absolutely so great that the other party couldn't even recognize you're on a headphone unless you're on streets as there is no ANC.Cons:1. All the buds are of plastic glossy feel attract dust and fingerprints.2. The not mentioned gaming mode zero latency that most youtubers blown in their recent reviews is just a gimmick, I didn't even spot any difference between the selections.3. Some pair of buds got mic problem like I'd got with my first pair, but the replacement pair worked fine so far.4. Bass is clear when u make perfect fit silicon straps. Wudve been perfect Basshead, if driver placed near to silicon caps. There is little bit of sound leakage I felt.5. Volume doesn't reach its loudness, need to use sound control apps for horror or some intensive low sound movies if you're watching.Overall a very good budget tws earbud.Thumps up for Amazon's quickest delivery even during this essentials only days! Hats off to all amazon's frontline delivery partners.The replacement also didn't take much of my time."

 Very nice product bass is also nice at this price point and vocals, treble and call quality is very nice. Everything is superb battery life also very nice sound output is also nice no disturbance and distortion. Very nice product. Sound quality also varies with ear size and ear tip size so try changing eartips from medium to other size based on your ear I changed to small then I got it fit perfectly in ear"
"I really like the product Premium, Classy and resembles airpods. Am happy with this product .Type c charging is provided which is useful. Must buy earbuds.. Awesome sound effect. Same sound quality as boat headsets. Overall performance is fabulous in this price range and I highly recommend It's is completely worth."
Honest review which no one will tell. Always hiss noise comes from the earbuds which is very irritating.Disconnection happens every now and then if you move a little away.It takes more time to charge fully than as it is mentioned.
Just received these a couple hours ago. I'm not sure if it's a defective product or not cuz the sound quality is just downright horrible. Vocals barely audible at max volume forget about bass. Tried with different phones. IOS and android. They sound the same. HORRIBLE. I've already ordered a replacement. Will update if they're any different.Edit.: received replacement today. Sound exactly the same. I'm perplexed as to how people are praising these and liking how they sound. They're exactly how fake tws sound if not worse. Wouldn't advise anyone to buy this.
Honestly I don't know what to say. I purchased it after reading positive reviews. Even after charging for 6hours it's say low better. Sound quality is average. Changing is a big issue. Waste of money. I had same issue with 1st product I received & requested for replacement. Product which I received after replacement have same issue. I wish if I could give 0 stars. It past the 8days of expected date of pickup but no one came to pick up. Such a unsatisfied customer service.
I am writing this review after 2 months ...Earphone is very cute and light box but after 2 months with occasional use hardly 10 times use the one piece is not charging at all.
I got my Boult Audio Airbass and it arrived in less time than expected the sound quality of this Bolt audio is super cool and the noise cancellation feature is also good that works very fine.the thing that I like the most about this product is that  the battery life of this product is till 24 hour that is more than enough for daily usage.and for the gamers it is Uber cool that it has a less sound latency and you can turn it on whenever you want..
The sound quality is horrible. The reception range is less than 1 metre.  It seems I got cheated on buying this. Now they should return the product and pay back.  I am Amazon pime customer and helpless after buying this.  Amazon should consider to return the product in place of replace.
"I received the product in 1 day, first experience was ok , light weight & good sound etc, but when the battery went low, it can't be charged. If it is not charging how can be used, so I ordered for replacement."

Battery backup is like never seen before on any of the TWS so far, lasted more than 9 hrs on full charge without the case.4. So light that u feel once adjusted, you won't feel itchiness, exact size silicon caps selection plays important role.5. Although case build quality is not upto the mark but fits in any of the jeans coin packet easily.6. Call quality is absolutely so great that the other party couldn't even recognize you're on a headphone unless you're on streets as there is no ANC.Cons:1. All the buds are of plastic glossy feel attract dust and fingerprints.2. The not mentioned gaming mode zero latency that most youtubers blown in their recent reviews is just a gimmick, I didn't even spot any difference between the selections.3. Some pair of buds got mic problem like I'd got with my first pair, but the replacement pair worked fine so far.4. Bass is clear when u make perfect fit silicon straps. Wudve been perfect Basshead, if driver placed near to silicon caps. There is little bit of sound leakage I felt.5. Volume doesn't reach its loudness, need to use sound control apps for horror or some intensive low sound movies if you're watching.Overall a very good budget tws earbud.Thumps up for Amazon's quickest delivery even during this essentials only days! Hats off to all amazon's frontline delivery partners.The replacement also didn't take much of my time."

 Very nice product bass is also nice at this price point and vocals, treble and call quality is very nice. Everything is superb battery life also very nice sound output is also nice no disturbance and distortion. Very nice product. Sound quality also varies with ear size and ear tip size so try changing eartips from medium to other size based on your ear I changed to small then I got it fit perfectly in ear"
"I really like the product Premium, Classy and resembles airpods. Am happy with this product .Type c charging is provided which is useful. Must buy earbuds.. Awesome sound effect. Same sound quality as boat headsets. Overall performance is fabulous in this price range and I highly recommend It's is completely worth."
Honest review which no one will tell. Always hiss noise comes from the earbuds which is very irritating.Disconnection happens every now and then if you move a little away.It takes more time to charge fully than as it is mentioned.
Just received these a couple hours ago. I'm not sure if it's a defective product or not cuz the sound quality is just downright horrible. Vocals barely audible at max volume forget about bass. Tried with different phones. IOS and android. They sound the same. HORRIBLE. I've already ordered a replacement. Will update if they're any different.Edit.: received replacement today. Sound exactly the same. I'm perplexed as to how people are praising these and liking how they sound. They're exactly how fake tws sound if not worse. Wouldn't advise anyone to buy this.
Honestly I don't know what to say. I purchased it after reading positive reviews. Even after charging for 6hours it's say low better. Sound quality is average. Changing is a big issue. Waste of money. I had same issue with 1st product I received & requested for replacement. Product which I received after replacement have same issue. I wish if I could give 0 stars. It past the 8days of expected date of pickup but no one came to pick up. Such a unsatisfied customer service.
I am writing this review after 2 months ...Earphone is very cute and light box but after 2 months with occasional use hardly 10 times use the one piece is not charging at all.
I got my Boult Audio Airbass and it arrived in less time than expected the sound quality of this Bolt audio is super cool and the noise cancellation feature is also good that works very fine.the thing that I like the most about this product is that  the battery life of this product is till 24 hour that is more than enough for daily usage.and for the gamers it is Uber cool that it has a less sound latency and you can turn it on whenever you want..
The sound quality is horrible. The reception range is less than 1 metre.  It seems I got cheated on buying this. Now they should return the product and pay back.  I am Amazon pime customer and helpless after buying this.  Amazon should consider to return the product in place of replace.
"I received the product in 1 day, first experience was ok , light weight & good sound etc, but when the battery went low, it can't be charged. If it is not charging how can be used, so I ordered for replacement."

Battery backup is like never seen before on any of the TWS so far, lasted more than 9 hrs on full charge without the case.4. So light that u feel once adjusted, you won't feel itchiness, exact size silicon caps selection plays important role.5. Although case build quality is not upto the mark but fits in any of the jeans coin packet easily.6. Call quality is absolutely so great that the other party couldn't even recognize you're on a headphone unless you're on streets as there is no ANC.Cons:1. All the buds are of plastic glossy feel attract dust and fingerprints.2. The not mentioned gaming mode zero latency that most youtubers blown in their recent reviews is just a gimmick, I didn't even spot any difference between the selections.3. Some pair of buds got mic problem like I'd got with my first pair, but the replacement pair worked fine so far.4. Bass is clear when u make perfect fit silicon straps. Wudve been perfect Basshead, if driver placed near to silicon caps. There is little bit of sound leakage I felt.5. Volume doesn't reach its loudness, need to use sound control apps for horror or some intensive low sound movies if you're watching.Overall a very good budget tws earbud.Thumps up for Amazon's quickest delivery even during this essentials only days! Hats off to all amazon's frontline delivery partners.The replacement also didn't take much of my time."

 Very nice product bass is also nice at this price point and vocals, treble and call quality is very nice. Everything is superb battery life also very nice sound output is also nice no disturbance and distortion. Very nice product. Sound quality also varies with ear size and ear tip size so try changing eartips from medium to other size based on your ear I changed to small then I got it fit perfectly in ear"
"I really like the product Premium, Classy and resembles airpods. Am happy with this product .Type c charging is provided which is useful. Must buy earbuds.. Awesome sound effect. Same sound quality as boat headsets. Overall performance is fabulous in this price range and I highly recommend It's is completely worth."
Honest review which no one will tell. Always hiss noise comes from the earbuds which is very irritating.Disconnection happens every now and then if you move a little away.It takes more time to charge fully than as it is mentioned.
Just received these a couple hours ago. I'm not sure if it's a defective product or not cuz the sound quality is just downright horrible. Vocals barely audible at max volume forget about bass. Tried with different phones. IOS and android. They sound the same. HORRIBLE. I've already ordered a replacement. Will update if they're any different.Edit.: received replacement today. Sound exactly the same. I'm perplexed as to how people are praising these and liking how they sound. They're exactly how fake tws sound if not worse. Wouldn't advise anyone to buy this.
Honestly I don't know what to say. I purchased it after reading positive reviews. Even after charging for 6hours it's say low better. Sound quality is average. Changing is a big issue. Waste of money. I had same issue with 1st product I received & requested for replacement. Product which I received after replacement have same issue. I wish if I could give 0 stars. It past the 8days of expected date of pickup but no one came to pick up. Such a unsatisfied customer service.
I am writing this review after 2 months ...Earphone is very cute and light box but after 2 months with occasional use hardly 10 times use the one piece is not charging at all.
I got my Boult Audio Airbass and it arrived in less time than expected the sound quality of this Bolt audio is super cool and the noise cancellation feature is also good that works very fine.the thing that I like the most about this product is that  the battery life of this product is till 24 hour that is more than enough for daily usage.and for the gamers it is Uber cool that it has a less sound latency and you can turn it on whenever you want..
The sound quality is horrible. The reception range is less than 1 metre.  It seems I got cheated on buying this. Now they should return the product and pay back.  I am Amazon pime customer and helpless after buying this.  Amazon should consider to return the product in place of replace.
"I received the product in 1 day, first experience was ok , light weight & good sound etc, but when the battery went low, it can't be charged. If it is not charging how can be used, so I ordered for replacement."

Battery backup is like never seen before on any of the TWS so far, lasted more than 9 hrs on full charge without the case.4. So light that u feel once adjusted, you won't feel itchiness, exact size silicon caps selection plays important role.5. Although case build quality is not upto the mark but fits in any of the jeans coin packet easily.6. Call quality is absolutely so great that the other party couldn't even recognize you're on a headphone unless you're on streets as there is no ANC.Cons:1. All the buds are of plastic glossy feel attract dust and fingerprints.2. The not mentioned gaming mode zero latency that most youtubers blown in their recent reviews is just a gimmick, I didn't even spot any difference between the selections.3. Some pair of buds got mic problem like I'd got with my first pair, but the replacement pair worked fine so far.4. Bass is clear when u make perfect fit silicon straps. Wudve been perfect Basshead, if driver placed near to silicon caps. There is little bit of sound leakage I felt.5. Volume doesn't reach its loudness, need to use sound control apps for horror or some intensive low sound movies if you're watching.Overall a very good budget tws earbud.Thumps up for Amazon's quickest delivery even during this essentials only days! Hats off to all amazon's frontline delivery partners.The replacement also didn't take much of my time."

 Very nice product bass is also nice at this price point and vocals, treble and call quality is very nice. Everything is superb battery life also very nice sound output is also nice no disturbance and distortion. Very nice product. Sound quality also varies with ear size and ear tip size so try changing eartips from medium to other size based on your ear I changed to small then I got it fit perfectly in ear"
"I really like the product Premium, Classy and resembles airpods. Am happy with this product .Type c charging is provided which is useful. Must buy earbuds.. Awesome sound effect. Same sound quality as boat headsets. Overall performance is fabulous in this price range and I highly recommend It's is completely worth."
Honest review which no one will tell. Always hiss noise comes from the earbuds which is very irritating.Disconnection happens every now and then if you move a little away.It takes more time to charge fully than as it is mentioned.
Just received these a couple hours ago. I'm not sure if it's a defective product or not cuz the sound quality is just downright horrible. Vocals barely audible at max volume forget about bass. Tried with different phones. IOS and android. They sound the same. HORRIBLE. I've already ordered a replacement. Will update if they're any different.Edit.: received replacement today. Sound exactly the same. I'm perplexed as to how people are praising these and liking how they sound. They're exactly how fake tws sound if not worse. Wouldn't advise anyone to buy this.
Honestly I don't know what to say. I purchased it after reading positive reviews. Even after charging for 6hours it's say low better. Sound quality is average. Changing is a big issue. Waste of money. I had same issue with 1st product I received & requested for replacement. Product which I received after replacement have same issue. I wish if I could give 0 stars. It past the 8days of expected date of pickup but no one came to pick up. Such a unsatisfied customer service.
I am writing this review after 2 months ...Earphone is very cute and light box but after 2 months with occasional use hardly 10 times use the one piece is not charging at all.
I got my Boult Audio Airbass and it arrived in less time than expected the sound quality of this Bolt audio is super cool and the noise cancellation feature is also good that works very fine.the thing that I like the most about this product is that  the battery life of this product is till 24 hour that is more than enough for daily usage.and for the gamers it is Uber cool that it has a less sound latency and you can turn it on whenever you want..
The sound quality is horrible. The reception range is less than 1 metre.  It seems I got cheated on buying this. Now they should return the product and pay back.  I am Amazon pime customer and helpless after buying this.  Amazon should consider to return the product in place of replace.
"I received the product in 1 day, first experience was ok , light weight & good sound etc, but when the battery went low, it can't be charged. If it is not charging how can be used, so I ordered for replacement."

Battery backup is like never seen before on any of the TWS so far, lasted more than 9 hrs on full charge without the case.4. So light that u feel once adjusted, you won't feel itchiness, exact size silicon caps selection plays important role.5. Although case build quality is not upto the mark but fits in any of the jeans coin packet easily.6. Call quality is absolutely so great that the other party couldn't even recognize you're on a headphone unless you're on streets as there is no ANC.Cons:1. All the buds are of plastic glossy feel attract dust and fingerprints.2. The not mentioned gaming mode zero latency that most youtubers blown in their recent reviews is just a gimmick, I didn't even spot any difference between the selections.3. Some pair of buds got mic problem like I'd got with my first pair, but the replacement pair worked fine so far.4. Bass is clear when u make perfect fit silicon straps. Wudve been perfect Basshead, if driver placed near to silicon caps. There is little bit of sound leakage I felt.5. Volume doesn't reach its loudness, need to use sound control apps for horror or some intensive low sound movies if you're watching.Overall a very good budget tws earbud.Thumps up for Amazon's quickest delivery even during this essentials only days! Hats off to all amazon's frontline delivery partners.The replacement also didn't take much of my time."

 Very nice product bass is also nice at this price point and vocals, treble and call quality is very nice. Everything is superb battery life also very nice sound output is also nice no disturbance and distortion. Very nice product. Sound quality also varies with ear size and ear tip size so try changing eartips from medium to other size based on your ear I changed to small then I got it fit perfectly in ear"
"I really like the product Premium, Classy and resembles airpods. Am happy with this product .Type c charging is provided which is useful. Must buy earbuds.. Awesome sound effect. Same sound quality as boat headsets. Overall performance is fabulous in this price range and I highly recommend It's is completely worth."
Honest review which no one will tell. Always hiss noise comes from the earbuds which is very irritating.Disconnection happens every now and then if you move a little away.It takes more time to charge fully than as it is mentioned.
Just received these a couple hours ago. I'm not sure if it's a defective product or not cuz the sound quality is just downright horrible. Vocals barely audible at max volume forget about bass. Tried with different phones. IOS and android. They sound the same. HORRIBLE. I've already ordered a replacement. Will update if they're any different.Edit.: received replacement today. Sound exactly the same. I'm perplexed as to how people are praising these and liking how they sound. They're exactly how fake tws sound if not worse. Wouldn't advise anyone to buy this.
Honestly I don't know what to say. I purchased it after reading positive reviews. Even after charging for 6hours it's say low better. Sound quality is average. Changing is a big issue. Waste of money. I had same issue with 1st product I received & requested for replacement. Product which I received after replacement have same issue. I wish if I could give 0 stars. It past the 8days of expected date of pickup but no one came to pick up. Such a unsatisfied customer service.
I am writing this review after 2 months ...Earphone is very cute and light box but after 2 months with occasional use hardly 10 times use the one piece is not charging at all.
I got my Boult Audio Airbass and it arrived in less time than expected the sound quality of this Bolt audio is super cool and the noise cancellation feature is also good that works very fine.the thing that I like the most about this product is that  the battery life of this product is till 24 hour that is more than enough for daily usage.and for the gamers it is Uber cool that it has a less sound latency and you can turn it on whenever you want..
The sound quality is horrible. The reception range is less than 1 metre.  It seems I got cheated on buying this. Now they should return the product and pay back.  I am Amazon pime customer and helpless after buying this.  Amazon should consider to return the product in place of replace.
"I received the product in 1 day, first experience was ok , light weight & good sound etc, but when the battery went low, it can't be charged. If it is not charging how can be used, so I ordered for replacement."

Battery backup is like never seen before on any of the TWS so far, lasted more than 9 hrs on full charge without the case.4. So light that u feel once adjusted, you won't feel itchiness, exact size silicon caps selection plays important role.5. Although case build quality is not upto the mark but fits in any of the jeans coin packet easily.6. Call quality is absolutely so great that the other party couldn't even recognize you're on a headphone unless you're on streets as there is no ANC.Cons:1. All the buds are of plastic glossy feel attract dust and fingerprints.2. The not mentioned gaming mode zero latency that most youtubers blown in their recent reviews is just a gimmick, I didn't even spot any difference between the selections.3. Some pair of buds got mic problem like I'd got with my first pair, but the replacement pair worked fine so far.4. Bass is clear when u make perfect fit silicon straps. Wudve been perfect Basshead, if driver placed near to silicon caps. There is little bit of sound leakage I felt.5. Volume doesn't reach its loudness, need to use sound control apps for horror or some intensive low sound movies if you're watching.Overall a very good budget tws earbud.Thumps up for Amazon's quickest delivery even during this essentials only days! Hats off to all amazon's frontline delivery partners.The replacement also didn't take much of my time."

 Very nice product bass is also nice at this price point and vocals, treble and call quality is very nice. Everything is superb battery life also very nice sound output is also nice no disturbance and distortion. Very nice product. Sound quality also varies with ear size and ear tip size so try changing eartips from medium to other size based on your ear I changed to small then I got it fit perfectly in ear"
"I really like the product Premium, Classy and resembles airpods. Am happy with this product .Type c charging is provided which is useful. Must buy earbuds.. Awesome sound effect. Same sound quality as boat headsets. Overall performance is fabulous in this price range and I highly recommend It's is completely worth."
Honest review which no one will tell. Always hiss noise comes from the earbuds which is very irritating.Disconnection happens every now and then if you move a little away.It takes more time to charge fully than as it is mentioned.
Just received these a couple hours ago. I'm not sure if it's a defective product or not cuz the sound quality is just downright horrible. Vocals barely audible at max volume forget about bass. Tried with different phones. IOS and android. They sound the same. HORRIBLE. I've already ordered a replacement. Will update if they're any different.Edit.: received replacement today. Sound exactly the same. I'm perplexed as to how people are praising these and liking how they sound. They're exactly how fake tws sound if not worse. Wouldn't advise anyone to buy this.
Honestly I don't know what to say. I purchased it after reading positive reviews. Even after charging for 6hours it's say low better. Sound quality is average. Changing is a big issue. Waste of money. I had same issue with 1st product I received & requested for replacement. Product which I received after replacement have same issue. I wish if I could give 0 stars. It past the 8days of expected date of pickup but no one came to pick up. Such a unsatisfied customer service.
I am writing this review after 2 months ...Earphone is very cute and light box but after 2 months with occasional use hardly 10 times use the one piece is not charging at all.
I got my Boult Audio Airbass and it arrived in less time than expected the sound quality of this Bolt audio is super cool and the noise cancellation feature is also good that works very fine.the thing that I like the most about this product is that  the battery life of this product is till 24 hour that is more than enough for daily usage.and for the gamers it is Uber cool that it has a less sound latency and you can turn it on whenever you want..
The sound quality is horrible. The reception range is less than 1 metre.  It seems I got cheated on buying this. Now they should return the product and pay back.  I am Amazon pime customer and helpless after buying this.  Amazon should consider to return the product in place of replace.
"I received the product in 1 day, first experience was ok , light weight & good sound etc, but when the battery went low, it can't be charged. If it is not charging how can be used, so I ordered for replacement."

Battery backup is like never seen before on any of the TWS so far, lasted more than 9 hrs on full charge without the case.4. So light that u feel once adjusted, you won't feel itchiness, exact size silicon caps selection plays important role.5. Although case build quality is not upto the mark but fits in any of the jeans coin packet easily.6. Call quality is absolutely so great that the other party couldn't even recognize you're on a headphone unless you're on streets as there is no ANC.Cons:1. All the buds are of plastic glossy feel attract dust and fingerprints.2. The not mentioned gaming mode zero latency that most youtubers blown in their recent reviews is just a gimmick, I didn't even spot any difference between the selections.3. Some pair of buds got mic problem like I'd got with my first pair, but the replacement pair worked fine so far.4. Bass is clear when u make perfect fit silicon straps. Wudve been perfect Basshead, if driver placed near to silicon caps. There is little bit of sound leakage I felt.5. Volume doesn't reach its loudness, need to use sound control apps for horror or some intensive low sound movies if you're watching.Overall a very good budget tws earbud.Thumps up for Amazon's quickest delivery even during this essentials only days! Hats off to all amazon's frontline delivery partners.The replacement also didn't take much of my time."

 Very nice product bass is also nice at this price point and vocals, treble and call quality is very nice. Everything is superb battery life also very nice sound output is also nice no disturbance and distortion. Very nice product. Sound quality also varies with ear size and ear tip size so try changing eartips from medium to other size based on your ear I changed to small then I got it fit perfectly in ear"
"I really like the product Premium, Classy and resembles airpods. Am happy with this product .Type c charging is provided which is useful. Must buy earbuds.. Awesome sound effect. Same sound quality as boat headsets. Overall performance is fabulous in this price range and I highly recommend It's is completely worth."
Honest review which no one will tell. Always hiss noise comes from the earbuds which is very irritating.Disconnection happens every now and then if you move a little away.It takes more time to charge fully than as it is mentioned.
Just received these a couple hours ago. I'm not sure if it's a defective product or not cuz the sound quality is just downright horrible. Vocals barely audible at max volume forget about bass. Tried with different phones. IOS and android. They sound the same. HORRIBLE. I've already ordered a replacement. Will update if they're any different.Edit.: received replacement today. Sound exactly the same. I'm perplexed as to how people are praising these and liking how they sound. They're exactly how fake tws sound if not worse. Wouldn't advise anyone to buy this.
Honestly I don't know what to say. I purchased it after reading positive reviews. Even after charging for 6hours it's say low better. Sound quality is average. Changing is a big issue. Waste of money. I had same issue with 1st product I received & requested for replacement. Product which I received after replacement have same issue. I wish if I could give 0 stars. It past the 8days of expected date of pickup but no one came to pick up. Such a unsatisfied customer service.
I am writing this review after 2 months ...Earphone is very cute and light box but after 2 months with occasional use hardly 10 times use the one piece is not charging at all.
I got my Boult Audio Airbass and it arrived in less time than expected the sound quality of this Bolt audio is super cool and the noise cancellation feature is also good that works very fine.the thing that I like the most about this product is that  the battery life of this product is till 24 hour that is more than enough for daily usage.and for the gamers it is Uber cool that it has a less sound latency and you can turn it on whenever you want..
The sound quality is horrible. The reception range is less than 1 metre.  It seems I got cheated on buying this. Now they should return the product and pay back.  I am Amazon pime customer and helpless after buying this.  Amazon should consider to return the product in place of replace.
"I received the product in 1 day, first experience was ok , light weight & good sound etc, but when the battery went low, it can't be charged. If it is not charging how can be used, so I ordered for replacement."

Battery backup is like never seen before on any of the TWS so far, lasted more than 9 hrs on full charge without the case.4. So light that u feel once adjusted, you won't feel itchiness, exact size silicon caps selection plays important role.5. Although case build quality is not upto the mark but fits in any of the jeans coin packet easily.6. Call quality is absolutely so great that the other party couldn't even recognize you're on a headphone unless you're on streets as there is no ANC.Cons:1. All the buds are of plastic glossy feel attract dust and fingerprints.2. The not mentioned gaming mode zero latency that most youtubers blown in their recent reviews is just a gimmick, I didn't even spot any difference between the selections.3. Some pair of buds got mic problem like I'd got with my first pair, but the replacement pair worked fine so far.4. Bass is clear when u make perfect fit silicon straps. Wudve been perfect Basshead, if driver placed near to silicon caps. There is little bit of sound leakage I felt.5. Volume doesn't reach its loudness, need to use sound control apps for horror or some intensive low sound movies if you're watching.Overall a very good budget tws earbud.Thumps up for Amazon's quickest delivery even during this essentials only days! Hats off to all amazon's frontline delivery partners.The replacement also didn't take much of my time."

 Very nice product bass is also nice at this price point and vocals, treble and call quality is very nice. Everything is superb battery life also very nice sound output is also nice no disturbance and distortion. Very nice product. Sound quality also varies with ear size and ear tip size so try changing eartips from medium to other size based on your ear I changed to small then I got it fit perfectly in ear"
"I really like the product Premium, Classy and resembles airpods. Am happy with this product .Type c charging is provided which is useful. Must buy earbuds.. Awesome sound effect. Same sound quality as boat headsets. Overall performance is fabulous in this price range and I highly recommend It's is completely worth."
Honest review which no one will tell. Always hiss noise comes from the earbuds which is very irritating.Disconnection happens every now and then if you move a little away.It takes more time to charge fully than as it is mentioned.
Just received these a couple hours ago. I'm not sure if it's a defective product or not cuz the sound quality is just downright horrible. Vocals barely audible at max volume forget about bass. Tried with different phones. IOS and android. They sound the same. HORRIBLE. I've already ordered a replacement. Will update if they're any different.Edit.: received replacement today. Sound exactly the same. I'm perplexed as to how people are praising these and liking how they sound. They're exactly how fake tws sound if not worse. Wouldn't advise anyone to buy this.
Honestly I don't know what to say. I purchased it after reading positive reviews. Even after charging for 6hours it's say low better. Sound quality is average. Changing is a big issue. Waste of money. I had same issue with 1st product I received & requested for replacement. Product which I received after replacement have same issue. I wish if I could give 0 stars. It past the 8days of expected date of pickup but no one came to pick up. Such a unsatisfied customer service.
I am writing this review after 2 months ...Earphone is very cute and light box but after 2 months with occasional use hardly 10 times use the one piece is not charging at all.
I got my Boult Audio Airbass and it arrived in less time than expected the sound quality of this Bolt audio is super cool and the noise cancellation feature is also good that works very fine.the thing that I like the most about this product is that  the battery life of this product is till 24 hour that is more than enough for daily usage.and for the gamers it is Uber cool that it has a less sound latency and you can turn it on whenever you want..
The sound quality is horrible. The reception range is less than 1 metre.  It seems I got cheated on buying this. Now they should return the product and pay back.  I am Amazon pime customer and helpless after buying this.  Amazon should consider to return the product in place of replace.
"I received the product in 1 day, first experience was ok , light weight & good sound etc, but when the battery went low, it can't be charged. If it is not charging how can be used, so I ordered for replacement."

Battery backup is like never seen before on any of the TWS so far, lasted more than 9 hrs on full charge without the case.4. So light that u feel once adjusted, you won't feel itchiness, exact size silicon caps selection plays important role.5. Although case build quality is not upto the mark but fits in any of the jeans coin packet easily.6. Call quality is absolutely so great that the other party couldn't even recognize you're on a headphone unless you're on streets as there is no ANC.Cons:1. All the buds are of plastic glossy feel attract dust and fingerprints.2. The not mentioned gaming mode zero latency that most youtubers blown in their recent reviews is just a gimmick, I didn't even spot any difference between the selections.3. Some pair of buds got mic problem like I'd got with my first pair, but the replacement pair worked fine so far.4. Bass is clear when u make perfect fit silicon straps. Wudve been perfect Basshead, if driver placed near to silicon caps. There is little bit of sound leakage I felt.5. Volume doesn't reach its loudness, need to use sound control apps for horror or some intensive low sound movies if you're watching.Overall a very good budget tws earbud.Thumps up for Amazon's quickest delivery even during this essentials only days! Hats off to all amazon's frontline delivery partners.The replacement also didn't take much of my time."

 Very nice product bass is also nice at this price point and vocals, treble and call quality is very nice. Everything is superb battery life also very nice sound output is also nice no disturbance and distortion. Very nice product. Sound quality also varies with ear size and ear tip size so try changing eartips from medium to other size based on your ear I changed to small then I got it fit perfectly in ear"
"I really like the product Premium, Classy and resembles airpods. Am happy with this product .Type c charging is provided which is useful. Must buy earbuds.. Awesome sound effect. Same sound quality as boat headsets. Overall performance is fabulous in this price range and I highly recommend It's is completely worth."
Honest review which no one will tell. Always hiss noise comes from the earbuds which is very irritating.Disconnection happens every now and then if you move a little away.It takes more time to charge fully than as it is mentioned.
Just received these a couple hours ago. I'm not sure if it's a defective product or not cuz the sound quality is just downright horrible. Vocals barely audible at max volume forget about bass. Tried with different phones. IOS and android. They sound the same. HORRIBLE. I've already ordered a replacement. Will update if they're any different.Edit.: received replacement today. Sound exactly the same. I'm perplexed as to how people are praising these and liking how they sound. They're exactly how fake tws sound if not worse. Wouldn't advise anyone to buy this.
Honestly I don't know what to say. I purchased it after reading positive reviews. Even after charging for 6hours it's say low better. Sound quality is average. Changing is a big issue. Waste of money. I had same issue with 1st product I received & requested for replacement. Product which I received after replacement have same issue. I wish if I could give 0 stars. It past the 8days of expected date of pickup but no one came to pick up. Such a unsatisfied customer service.
I am writing this review after 2 months ...Earphone is very cute and light box but after 2 months with occasional use hardly 10 times use the one piece is not charging at all.
I got my Boult Audio Airbass and it arrived in less time than expected the sound quality of this Bolt audio is super cool and the noise cancellation feature is also good that works very fine.the thing that I like the most about this product is that  the battery life of this product is till 24 hour that is more than enough for daily usage.and for the gamers it is Uber cool that it has a less sound latency and you can turn it on whenever you want..
The sound quality is horrible. The reception range is less than 1 metre.  It seems I got cheated on buying this. Now they should return the product and pay back.  I am Amazon pime customer and helpless after buying this.  Amazon should consider to return the product in place of replace.
"I received the product in 1 day, first experience was ok , light weight & good sound etc, but when the battery went low, it can't be charged. If it is not charging how can be used, so I ordered for replacement."

Battery backup is like never seen before on any of the TWS so far, lasted more than 9 hrs on full charge without the case.4. So light that u feel once adjusted, you won't feel itchiness, exact size silicon caps selection plays important role.5. Although case build quality is not upto the mark but fits in any of the jeans coin packet easily.6. Call quality is absolutely so great that the other party couldn't even recognize you're on a headphone unless you're on streets as there is no ANC.Cons:1. All the buds are of plastic glossy feel attract dust and fingerprints.2. The not mentioned gaming mode zero latency that most youtubers blown in their recent reviews is just a gimmick, I didn't even spot any difference between the selections.3. Some pair of buds got mic problem like I'd got with my first pair, but the replacement pair worked fine so far.4. Bass is clear when u make perfect fit silicon straps. Wudve been perfect Basshead, if driver placed near to silicon caps. There is little bit of sound leakage I felt.5. Volume doesn't reach its loudness, need to use sound control apps for horror or some intensive low sound movies if you're watching.Overall a very good budget tws earbud.Thumps up for Amazon's quickest delivery even during this essentials only days! Hats off to all amazon's frontline delivery partners.The replacement also didn't take much of my time."

 Very nice product bass is also nice at this price point and vocals, treble and call quality is very nice. Everything is superb battery life also very nice sound output is also nice no disturbance and distortion. Very nice product. Sound quality also varies with ear size and ear tip size so try changing eartips from medium to other size based on your ear I changed to small then I got it fit perfectly in ear"
"I really like the product Premium, Classy and resembles airpods. Am happy with this product .Type c charging is provided which is useful. Must buy earbuds.. Awesome sound effect. Same sound quality as boat headsets. Overall performance is fabulous in this price range and I highly recommend It's is completely worth."
Honest review which no one will tell. Always hiss noise comes from the earbuds which is very irritating.Disconnection happens every now and then if you move a little away.It takes more time to charge fully than as it is mentioned.
Just received these a couple hours ago. I'm not sure if it's a defective product or not cuz the sound quality is just downright horrible. Vocals barely audible at max volume forget about bass. Tried with different phones. IOS and android. They sound the same. HORRIBLE. I've already ordered a replacement. Will update if they're any different.Edit.: received replacement today. Sound exactly the same. I'm perplexed as to how people are praising these and liking how they sound. They're exactly how fake tws sound if not worse. Wouldn't advise anyone to buy this.
Honestly I don't know what to say. I purchased it after reading positive reviews. Even after charging for 6hours it's say low better. Sound quality is average. Changing is a big issue. Waste of money. I had same issue with 1st product I received & requested for replacement. Product which I received after replacement have same issue. I wish if I could give 0 stars. It past the 8days of expected date of pickup but no one came to pick up. Such a unsatisfied customer service.
I am writing this review after 2 months ...Earphone is very cute and light box but after 2 months with occasional use hardly 10 times use the one piece is not charging at all.
I got my Boult Audio Airbass and it arrived in less time than expected the sound quality of this Bolt audio is super cool and the noise cancellation feature is also good that works very fine.the thing that I like the most about this product is that  the battery life of this product is till 24 hour that is more than enough for daily usage.and for the gamers it is Uber cool that it has a less sound latency and you can turn it on whenever you want..
The sound quality is horrible. The reception range is less than 1 metre.  It seems I got cheated on buying this. Now they should return the product and pay back.  I am Amazon pime customer and helpless after buying this.  Amazon should consider to return the product in place of replace.
"I received the product in 1 day, first experience was ok , light weight & good sound etc, but when the battery went low, it can't be charged. If it is not charging how can be used, so I ordered for replacement."

Battery backup is like never seen before on any of the TWS so far, lasted more than 9 hrs on full charge without the case.4. So light that u feel once adjusted, you won't feel itchiness, exact size silicon caps selection plays important role.5. Although case build quality is not upto the mark but fits in any of the jeans coin packet easily.6. Call quality is absolutely so great that the other party couldn't even recognize you're on a headphone unless you're on streets as there is no ANC.Cons:1. All the buds are of plastic glossy feel attract dust and fingerprints.2. The not mentioned gaming mode zero latency that most youtubers blown in their recent reviews is just a gimmick, I didn't even spot any difference between the selections.3. Some pair of buds got mic problem like I'd got with my first pair, but the replacement pair worked fine so far.4. Bass is clear when u make perfect fit silicon straps. Wudve been perfect Basshead, if driver placed near to silicon caps. There is little bit of sound leakage I felt.5. Volume doesn't reach its loudness, need to use sound control apps for horror or some intensive low sound movies if you're watching.Overall a very good budget tws earbud.Thumps up for Amazon's quickest delivery even during this essentials only days! Hats off to all amazon's frontline delivery partners.The replacement also didn't take much of my time."

 Very nice product bass is also nice at this price point and vocals, treble and call quality is very nice. Everything is superb battery life also very nice sound output is also nice no disturbance and distortion. Very nice product. Sound quality also varies with ear size and ear tip size so try changing eartips from medium to other size based on your ear I changed to small then I got it fit perfectly in ear"
"I really like the product Premium, Classy and resembles airpods. Am happy with this product .Type c charging is provided which is useful. Must buy earbuds.. Awesome sound effect. Same sound quality as boat headsets. Overall performance is fabulous in this price range and I highly recommend It's is completely worth."
Honest review which no one will tell. Always hiss noise comes from the earbuds which is very irritating.Disconnection happens every now and then if you move a little away.It takes more time to charge fully than as it is mentioned.
Just received these a couple hours ago. I'm not sure if it's a defective product or not cuz the sound quality is just downright horrible. Vocals barely audible at max volume forget about bass. Tried with different phones. IOS and android. They sound the same. HORRIBLE. I've already ordered a replacement. Will update if they're any different.Edit.: received replacement today. Sound exactly the same. I'm perplexed as to how people are praising these and liking how they sound. They're exactly how fake tws sound if not worse. Wouldn't advise anyone to buy this.
Honestly I don't know what to say. I purchased it after reading positive reviews. Even after charging for 6hours it's say low better. Sound quality is average. Changing is a big issue. Waste of money. I had same issue with 1st product I received & requested for replacement. Product which I received after replacement have same issue. I wish if I could give 0 stars. It past the 8days of expected date of pickup but no one came to pick up. Such a unsatisfied customer service.
I am writing this review after 2 months ...Earphone is very cute and light box but after 2 months with occasional use hardly 10 times use the one piece is not charging at all.
I got my Boult Audio Airbass and it arrived in less time than expected the sound quality of this Bolt audio is super cool and the noise cancellation feature is also good that works very fine.the thing that I like the most about this product is that  the battery life of this product is till 24 hour that is more than enough for daily usage.and for the gamers it is Uber cool that it has a less sound latency and you can turn it on whenever you want..
The sound quality is horrible. The reception range is less than 1 metre.  It seems I got cheated on buying this. Now they should return the product and pay back.  I am Amazon pime customer and helpless after buying this.  Amazon should consider to return the product in place of replace.
"I received the product in 1 day, first experience was ok , light weight & good sound etc, but when the battery went low, it can't be charged. If it is not charging how can be used, so I ordered for replacement."

Battery backup is like never seen before on any of the TWS so far, lasted more than 9 hrs on full charge without the case.4. So light that u feel once adjusted, you won't feel itchiness, exact size silicon caps selection plays important role.5. Although case build quality is not upto the mark but fits in any of the jeans coin packet easily.6. Call quality is absolutely so great that the other party couldn't even recognize you're on a headphone unless you're on streets as there is no ANC.Cons:1. All the buds are of plastic glossy feel attract dust and fingerprints.2. The not mentioned gaming mode zero latency that most youtubers blown in their recent reviews is just a gimmick, I didn't even spot any difference between the selections.3. Some pair of buds got mic problem like I'd got with my first pair, but the replacement pair worked fine so far.4. Bass is clear when u make perfect fit silicon straps. Wudve been perfect Basshead, if driver placed near to silicon caps. There is little bit of sound leakage I felt.5. Volume doesn't reach its loudness, need to use sound control apps for horror or some intensive low sound movies if you're watching.Overall a very good budget tws earbud.Thumps up for Amazon's quickest delivery even during this essentials only days! Hats off to all amazon's frontline delivery partners.The replacement also didn't take much of my time."

 Very nice product bass is also nice at this price point and vocals, treble and call quality is very nice. Everything is superb battery life also very nice sound output is also nice no disturbance and distortion. Very nice product. Sound quality also varies with ear size and ear tip size so try changing eartips from medium to other size based on your ear I changed to small then I got it fit perfectly in ear"
"I really like the product Premium, Classy and resembles airpods. Am happy with this product .Type c charging is provided which is useful. Must buy earbuds.. Awesome sound effect. Same sound quality as boat headsets. Overall performance is fabulous in this price range and I highly recommend It's is completely worth."
Honest review which no one will tell. Always hiss noise comes from the earbuds which is very irritating.Disconnection happens every now and then if you move a little away.It takes more time to charge fully than as it is mentioned.
Just received these a couple hours ago. I'm not sure if it's a defective product or not cuz the sound quality is just downright horrible. Vocals barely audible at max volume forget about bass. Tried with different phones. IOS and android. They sound the same. HORRIBLE. I've already ordered a replacement. Will update if they're any different.Edit.: received replacement today. Sound exactly the same. I'm perplexed as to how people are praising these and liking how they sound. They're exactly how fake tws sound if not worse. Wouldn't advise anyone to buy this.
Honestly I don't know what to say. I purchased it after reading positive reviews. Even after charging for 6hours it's say low better. Sound quality is average. Changing is a big issue. Waste of money. I had same issue with 1st product I received & requested for replacement. Product which I received after replacement have same issue. I wish if I could give 0 stars. It past the 8days of expected date of pickup but no one came to pick up. Such a unsatisfied customer service.
I am writing this review after 2 months ...Earphone is very cute and light box but after 2 months with occasional use hardly 10 times use the one piece is not charging at all.
I got my Boult Audio Airbass and it arrived in less time than expected the sound quality of this Bolt audio is super cool and the noise cancellation feature is also good that works very fine.the thing that I like the most about this product is that  the battery life of this product is till 24 hour that is more than enough for daily usage.and for the gamers it is Uber cool that it has a less sound latency and you can turn it on whenever you want..
The sound quality is horrible. The reception range is less than 1 metre.  It seems I got cheated on buying this. Now they should return the product and pay back.  I am Amazon pime customer and helpless after buying this.  Amazon should consider to return the product in place of replace.
"I received the product in 1 day, first experience was ok , light weight & good sound etc, but when the battery went low, it can't be charged. If it is not charging how can be used, so I ordered for replacement."

Battery backup is like never seen before on any of the TWS so far, lasted more than 9 hrs on full charge without the case.4. So light that u feel once adjusted, you won't feel itchiness, exact size silicon caps selection plays important role.5. Although case build quality is not upto the mark but fits in any of the jeans coin packet easily.6. Call quality is absolutely so great that the other party couldn't even recognize you're on a headphone unless you're on streets as there is no ANC.Cons:1. All the buds are of plastic glossy feel attract dust and fingerprints.2. The not mentioned gaming mode zero latency that most youtubers blown in their recent reviews is just a gimmick, I didn't even spot any difference between the selections.3. Some pair of buds got mic problem like I'd got with my first pair, but the replacement pair worked fine so far.4. Bass is clear when u make perfect fit silicon straps. Wudve been perfect Basshead, if driver placed near to silicon caps. There is little bit of sound leakage I felt.5. Volume doesn't reach its loudness, need to use sound control apps for horror or some intensive low sound movies if you're watching.Overall a very good budget tws earbud.Thumps up for Amazon's quickest delivery even during this essentials only days! Hats off to all amazon's frontline delivery partners.The replacement also didn't take much of my time."

 Very nice product bass is also nice at this price point and vocals, treble and call quality is very nice. Everything is superb battery life also very nice sound output is also nice no disturbance and distortion. Very nice product. Sound quality also varies with ear size and ear tip size so try changing eartips from medium to other size based on your ear I changed to small then I got it fit perfectly in ear"
"I really like the product Premium, Classy and resembles airpods. Am happy with this product .Type c charging is provided which is useful. Must buy earbuds.. Awesome sound effect. Same sound quality as boat headsets. Overall performance is fabulous in this price range and I highly recommend It's is completely worth."
Honest review which no one will tell. Always hiss noise comes from the earbuds which is very irritating.Disconnection happens every now and then if you move a little away.It takes more time to charge fully than as it is mentioned.
Just received these a couple hours ago. I'm not sure if it's a defective product or not cuz the sound quality is just downright horrible. Vocals barely audible at max volume forget about bass. Tried with different phones. IOS and android. They sound the same. HORRIBLE. I've already ordered a replacement. Will update if they're any different.Edit.: received replacement today. Sound exactly the same. I'm perplexed as to how people are praising these and liking how they sound. They're exactly how fake tws sound if not worse. Wouldn't advise anyone to buy this.
Honestly I don't know what to say. I purchased it after reading positive reviews. Even after charging for 6hours it's say low better. Sound quality is average. Changing is a big issue. Waste of money. I had same issue with 1st product I received & requested for replacement. Product which I received after replacement have same issue. I wish if I could give 0 stars. It past the 8days of expected date of pickup but no one came to pick up. Such a unsatisfied customer service.
I am writing this review after 2 months ...Earphone is very cute and light box but after 2 months with occasional use hardly 10 times use the one piece is not charging at all.
I got my Boult Audio Airbass and it arrived in less time than expected the sound quality of this Bolt audio is super cool and the noise cancellation feature is also good that works very fine.the thing that I like the most about this product is that  the battery life of this product is till 24 hour that is more than enough for daily usage.and for the gamers it is Uber cool that it has a less sound latency and you can turn it on whenever you want..
The sound quality is horrible. The reception range is less than 1 metre.  It seems I got cheated on buying this. Now they should return the product and pay back.  I am Amazon pime customer and helpless after buying this.  Amazon should consider to return the product in place of replace.
"I received the product in 1 day, first experience was ok , light weight & good sound etc, but when the battery went low, it can't be charged. If it is not charging how can be used, so I ordered for replacement."

Battery backup is like never seen before on any of the TWS so far, lasted more than 9 hrs on full charge without the case.4. So light that u feel once adjusted, you won't feel itchiness, exact size silicon caps selection plays important role.5. Although case build quality is not upto the mark but fits in any of the jeans coin packet easily.6. Call quality is absolutely so great that the other party couldn't even recognize you're on a headphone unless you're on streets as there is no ANC.Cons:1. All the buds are of plastic glossy feel attract dust and fingerprints.2. The not mentioned gaming mode zero latency that most youtubers blown in their recent reviews is just a gimmick, I didn't even spot any difference between the selections.3. Some pair of buds got mic problem like I'd got with my first pair, but the replacement pair worked fine so far.4. Bass is clear when u make perfect fit silicon straps. Wudve been perfect Basshead, if driver placed near to silicon caps. There is little bit of sound leakage I felt.5. Volume doesn't reach its loudness, need to use sound control apps for horror or some intensive low sound movies if you're watching.Overall a very good budget tws earbud.Thumps up for Amazon's quickest delivery even during this essentials only days! Hats off to all amazon's frontline delivery partners.The replacement also didn't take much of my time."

 Very nice product bass is also nice at this price point and vocals, treble and call quality is very nice. Everything is superb battery life also very nice sound output is also nice no disturbance and distortion. Very nice product. Sound quality also varies with ear size and ear tip size so try changing eartips from medium to other size based on your ear I changed to small then I got it fit perfectly in ear"
"I really like the product Premium, Classy and resembles airpods. Am happy with this product .Type c charging is provided which is useful. Must buy earbuds.. Awesome sound effect. Same sound quality as boat headsets. Overall performance is fabulous in this price range and I highly recommend It's is completely worth."
Honest review which no one will tell. Always hiss noise comes from the earbuds which is very irritating.Disconnection happens every now and then if you move a little away.It takes more time to charge fully than as it is mentioned.
Just received these a couple hours ago. I'm not sure if it's a defective product or not cuz the sound quality is just downright horrible. Vocals barely audible at max volume forget about bass. Tried with different phones. IOS and android. They sound the same. HORRIBLE. I've already ordered a replacement. Will update if they're any different.Edit.: received replacement today. Sound exactly the same. I'm perplexed as to how people are praising these and liking how they sound. They're exactly how fake tws sound if not worse. Wouldn't advise anyone to buy this.
Honestly I don't know what to say. I purchased it after reading positive reviews. Even after charging for 6hours it's say low better. Sound quality is average. Changing is a big issue. Waste of money. I had same issue with 1st product I received & requested for replacement. Product which I received after replacement have same issue. I wish if I could give 0 stars. It past the 8days of expected date of pickup but no one came to pick up. Such a unsatisfied customer service.
I am writing this review after 2 months ...Earphone is very cute and light box but after 2 months with occasional use hardly 10 times use the one piece is not charging at all.
I got my Boult Audio Airbass and it arrived in less time than expected the sound quality of this Bolt audio is super cool and the noise cancellation feature is also good that works very fine.the thing that I like the most about this product is that  the battery life of this product is till 24 hour that is more than enough for daily usage.and for the gamers it is Uber cool that it has a less sound latency and you can turn it on whenever you want..
The sound quality is horrible. The reception range is less than 1 metre.  It seems I got cheated on buying this. Now they should return the product and pay back.  I am Amazon pime customer and helpless after buying this.  Amazon should consider to return the product in place of replace.
"I received the product in 1 day, first experience was ok , light weight & good sound etc, but when the battery went low, it can't be charged. If it is not charging how can be used, so I ordered for replacement."

Battery backup is like never seen before on any of the TWS so far, lasted more than 9 hrs on full charge without the case.4. So light that u feel once adjusted, you won't feel itchiness, exact size silicon caps selection plays important role.5. Although case build quality is not upto the mark but fits in any of the jeans coin packet easily.6. Call quality is absolutely so great that the other party couldn't even recognize you're on a headphone unless you're on streets as there is no ANC.Cons:1. All the buds are of plastic glossy feel attract dust and fingerprints.2. The not mentioned gaming mode zero latency that most youtubers blown in their recent reviews is just a gimmick, I didn't even spot any difference between the selections.3. Some pair of buds got mic problem like I'd got with my first pair, but the replacement pair worked fine so far.4. Bass is clear when u make perfect fit silicon straps. Wudve been perfect Basshead, if driver placed near to silicon caps. There is little bit of sound leakage I felt.5. Volume doesn't reach its loudness, need to use sound control apps for horror or some intensive low sound movies if you're watching.Overall a very good budget tws earbud.Thumps up for Amazon's quickest delivery even during this essentials only days! Hats off to all amazon's frontline delivery partners.The replacement also didn't take much of my time."

 Very nice product bass is also nice at this price point and vocals, treble and call quality is very nice. Everything is superb battery life also very nice sound output is also nice no disturbance and distortion. Very nice product. Sound quality also varies with ear size and ear tip size so try changing eartips from medium to other size based on your ear I changed to small then I got it fit perfectly in ear"
"I really like the product Premium, Classy and resembles airpods. Am happy with this product .Type c charging is provided which is useful. Must buy earbuds.. Awesome sound effect. Same sound quality as boat headsets. Overall performance is fabulous in this price range and I highly recommend It's is completely worth."
Honest review which no one will tell. Always hiss noise comes from the earbuds which is very irritating.Disconnection happens every now and then if you move a little away.It takes more time to charge fully than as it is mentioned.
Just received these a couple hours ago. I'm not sure if it's a defective product or not cuz the sound quality is just downright horrible. Vocals barely audible at max volume forget about bass. Tried with different phones. IOS and android. They sound the same. HORRIBLE. I've already ordered a replacement. Will update if they're any different.Edit.: received replacement today. Sound exactly the same. I'm perplexed as to how people are praising these and liking how they sound. They're exactly how fake tws sound if not worse. Wouldn't advise anyone to buy this.
Honestly I don't know what to say. I purchased it after reading positive reviews. Even after charging for 6hours it's say low better. Sound quality is average. Changing is a big issue. Waste of money. I had same issue with 1st product I received & requested for replacement. Product which I received after replacement have same issue. I wish if I could give 0 stars. It past the 8days of expected date of pickup but no one came to pick up. Such a unsatisfied customer service.
I am writing this review after 2 months ...Earphone is very cute and light box but after 2 months with occasional use hardly 10 times use the one piece is not charging at all.
I got my Boult Audio Airbass and it arrived in less time than expected the sound quality of this Bolt audio is super cool and the noise cancellation feature is also good that works very fine.the thing that I like the most about this product is that  the battery life of this product is till 24 hour that is more than enough for daily usage.and for the gamers it is Uber cool that it has a less sound latency and you can turn it on whenever you want..
The sound quality is horrible. The reception range is less than 1 metre.  It seems I got cheated on buying this. Now they should return the product and pay back.  I am Amazon pime customer and helpless after buying this.  Amazon should consider to return the product in place of replace.
"I received the product in 1 day, first experience was ok , light weight & good sound etc, but when the battery went low, it can't be charged. If it is not charging how can be used, so I ordered for replacement."
